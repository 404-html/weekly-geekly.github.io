This device previously belonged to one of the murdered terrorists, who last year, along with other terrorists, organized a shooting at the center for help to the disabled, killing and wounding several dozen people.  For several months now, the FBI has been trying to unlock a criminal’s smartphone, but so far has not been successful. <br><br>  The FBI needs data from a smartphone to find out if this terrorist was connected to ISIS, as well as to get other important information for investigation.  As you know, the latest Apple’s smartphones protect user information with encryption.  If the access password is entered incorrectly 10 times, the information is erased.  The model that the FBI is currently working with is the iPhone 5c. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Yesterday, a judge ruled that Apple must help the FBI.  The government is requesting Apple software to get data from a smartphone automatically.  The court order <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-wants-apple-to-help-unlock-iphone-used-by-san-bernardino-shooter/2016/02/16/69b903ee-d4d9-11e5-9823-02b905009f99_story.html">says</a> that Apple needs to remove the restriction on 10 incorrect attempts to access information, after which the data is erased.  To decrypt information to which Apple does not have a key, no one asks. <br><br>  At the same time, Apple has already provided all the information available to the corporation in the case of the terrorist attack (information stored on Apple servers).  “When the FBI requested the data we had, we provided it.  Apple is subject to valid court decisions and search warrants, as was the case with San Bernardino.  We also provided our developers to advise the FBI and offered our best ideas on a number of issues during the investigation, ”Apple said.  Now the FBI also requires the creation of an actual backdoor for iOS.  This is not what the corporation is planning. <br><br>  Apple’s <a href="http://kommersant.ru/doc/2918275">statement</a> also <a href="http://kommersant.ru/doc/2918275">says</a> : “We are extremely respectful of professionals working for the FBI, and we believe that they are acting with the best of intentions.  Up to this point, we have done everything in our power and within the law to help them.  But we simply do not have what the US government is asking of us now.  And we believe that creating something like this will be too dangerous - after all, they asked us to create a way around the protection system of the iPhone. ” <br><br>  Here, a number of questions arise about whether Apple can do this for a single smartphone at all, and whether corporations will have to perform such requests regularly in the future.  Theoretically, Apple developers can write the necessary software, but this will already be something like a backdoor, which can go public.  After that, we don’t have to talk about the reliable data protection of the iPhone smartphone user. <br><br>  Read the full text of the court decision <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160216/17393733617/no-judge-did-not-just-order-apple-to-break-encryption-san-bernardino-shooters-iphone-to-create-new-backdoor.shtml">here</a> .
