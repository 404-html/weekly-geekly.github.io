  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Modders have attracted AI to improve textures in games</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Morrowind-Feature-640x353.jpg" width="300" align="left">  Artificial intelligence (of course, its weak form) allows you to automate the solution of a huge number of tasks and, in general, simplify human life.  Most different branches of science and technology are already using technology based on artificial intelligence.  The game industry also works with AI, in particular, to improve the ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù of the NPC and the laws of the game universe. <br><br>  But AI can also be used to optimize graphics.  Cases are known when technology helped restore an old, almost spoiled photo or update some old film recorded on a damaged film.  But there is another possibility - the improvement of graphics in games. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Many modders are committed to creating fashions for old popular games or updating the games themselves with improved graphics.  As an example, Resident Evil 4 with HD textures.  The game with the updated graphics is much closer to modern gamers than its original version. <br><br>  But to update the graphics in the whole game you need a huge amount of time, so modders often do their work for years.  Now artificial intelligence can be involved in this task.  Recently, the network has information that Doom 2 and Morrowind have already been released with exactly this updated graphics. <br><br>  In the case of Doom 2, the author of the novelty, hidfan, used the specialized tools of Nvidia Gameworks, as well as the AI ‚Äã‚ÄãGigapixel tool from Topaz Lab.  Both services are needed in order to improve the quality of textures, then return to the previous resolution with the removal of AI artifacts.  True, some artifacts and transparency need to be configured manually.  By the way, according to the same hidfan, AI cannot deal with Black &amp; White. <br><br>  As for the second game, Morrowind, a whole team of modders worked on it, who <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46221%3Ftab%3Ddescription">used</a> ESRGAN (Enhanced Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks).  This tool allows you to improve the image with not too high-quality resolution. <br><br><img src="https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/FamilyPoster-640x179.jpg"><br><br>  According to representatives of the team, after a couple of tricks the service starts working, making the images more realistic.  In particular, the texture of Morrowind was improved thanks to the ESRGAN.  An example of the image before and after processing - below.  Texture quality was improved four times. <br><br><img src="https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/46221-1544831305-62299445-640x520.png"><br><br>  Currently, this kind of technology is only in its infancy, but its potential is clear.  If you ‚Äútrain‚Äù artificial intelligence to improve the graphics of old games, gamers around the world will get a large number of classic games in the ‚Äúnew wrapper‚Äù.  If AI learns to improve the quality of the video, then Star Trek: Deep Space 9, Babylon 5 lovers can watch their favorite episodes with double pleasure. <br><br>  The above mentioned tools from NVIDIA, and not in vain.  This company has long been working on the integration of AI capabilities in work with graphics and video.  Earlier this month, the company introduced a software platform that allows you to combine the effects generated by artificial intelligence with the graphics engine of games.  The basis of the platform is a neural network of the GAN type (generative contention network).  Using the same neural network, NVIDIA has learned to generate people's faces in unprecedented quality. <br><br><img src="https://cs8.pikabu.ru/post_img/2018/12/04/9/1543939056142675857.jpg"><br><br>  This technology can be used not only for games, but also for creating movies or VR content.  As for the images placed above, they are taken from the ‚Äúgame‚Äù that AI created.  Initially, the system was trained to drive on robotic algorithms.  Then, when the learning process was completed, the AI ‚Äã‚Äãtrained to identify various objects, including the sky, cars, trees, roads, markings, etc.  As a result, the platform created its own universe based on the Unreal Engine 4. The graphics in this world are generated in real time. <br><br><img src="https://cs10.pikabu.ru/post_img/2018/12/04/9/1543939001153129148.jpg"><br><br>  However, even this modern technology is only at the beginning of its journey - it may take a long time to commercialize it.  Nevertheless, NVIDIA has achieved a lot, if this company will improve its product, in a few years we can talk about the possibility of using the platform for solving practical problems. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/433956/">https://habr.com/ru/post/433956/</a></p>
