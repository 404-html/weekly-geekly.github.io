  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Amateur in opensource - lessons learned for 3 years</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  A long time ago, in 2014, I made a small utility for myself in order to translate the C # model into the TypeScript code.  She saved me a lot of time and nerves.  And so, in September 2015, I decided to arrange my “experiments on the knee” in some kind of digestible form and pour them onto GitHub.  So began my amateurish participation in the development of open source software.  As time went.  And so, yesterday in the repository with this project, finally, the anniversary, 300th kommit appeared.  In connection with this significant event, I would like to share my amateurish experience about what you will have to face if you suddenly come up with the idea of ​​developing something "for the benefit of the development of the industry."  I will state some numbers, tell some cool stories, and share my impressions of what it is to write and maintain an opensource-project without <del>  moms, dads and loans </del>  company support, payment and ... and free time.  Come under the cut, sit down, we begin. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1 id="delayte-poleznoe">  "Do useful" </h1><br><p>  Let's start with the fact that on GitHub more than <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">90 million repositories</a> .  Some of them are known, some are not very, some are generally private.  In view of the mass popularity, students began to use Github for assignments, teachers for lectures, authors of books for tutorials, and even <a href="https://github.com/bundestag/gesetze">enthusiasts for legislation</a> .  Just imagine what a fucking abyss of code and projects it is!  However, I put a bottle of brandy that if a journalist gets attached to you right now and asks to name known repositories, you will call it offhand ... well, about 15-30.  What does this mean?  So this is what GitHub is a huge universe of software products, most of which, I am sure, are known only to their authors.  And maybe 5-10 to their friends. </p><br><blockquote>  Becoming more or less noticeable in this crowd is quite difficult, I tell you. </blockquote><p>  Even if you steal the data of bank cards of all-all users of the world and put them on GitHub, then I am sure that <del>  you are banned and prosecuted </del>  This is <em>just no one will notice</em> .  Why am I telling such obvious things, you ask?  But ... damn they are not obvious!  Especially for the author of these lines :) Especially 3 years ago.  Then I naively thought that it was enough to do something really useful, specify the tags, write the README and people will find everything themselves, download everything themselves.  Well, seriously, since some kind of <a href="https://github.com/stevemao/left-pad">left-pad</a> , consisting essentially of 47 lines of code, scored a thousand stars, my thing, which objectively simplifies development - well, 300 will be typed, right? </p><br><p>  Hmmm ... no.  Unfortunately, this does not work.  The left-pad was created in 2014 and was completely unknown to anyone until the <a href="https://habr.com/post/280039/">famous events of 2016</a> .  If you look at the graph of the distribution of stars, then we can observe a rise almost at 90 degrees just at that very ill-fated time.  From this marvelous story, there are obviously some sad conclusions: </p><br><blockquote>  Without proper marketing, your best idea in the world will go unnoticed. <br>  Black PR is also PR. <br>  Not always a crazy number of stars suggests that the project is good. </blockquote><p>  But it is not all that bad.  If you are already prepared to get depressed about this, then my advice to you is to set aside the handkerchiefs and the pillow for sobbing. </p><br><blockquote>  Better do something useful.  First of all - useful for yourself. </blockquote><p>  Estimate without any software product, your life is not a joy.  Here to you personally, reading this post.  What application, framework, service <del>  hell </del>  you are lacking?  At your work or in your daily life.  Estimated?  Fine.  Hammer in Google and if from the issuance of your request blows melancholy and inaudible - go ahead!  Get a repository, open IDE and write.  Write what you dreamed about, collect and share.  The solution is simple - if specifically your project benefits you, then around the world, most likely, there will be a thousand or other people to whom it will also help and who will be grateful to you.  I am sure that for the first time such an audience is more than enough for you.  Then it's up to you to bring your work to all these wonderful people and not to spill it along the way. </p><br><h1 id="piar-bez-shtanov">  PR without pants </h1><br><p>  I heard, in some companies there is such a practice.  If at the interview, the candidate mentions his opensource project, then the very next paragraph begins to crucify him on the topic “how many stars?”, “How many downloads?”, “How many live projects are used?”.  So, I declare to you responsibly: such questioners should be sent to the stump with a quick and decisive movement of the language, get up and leave the interview, forgetting forever the name of this company and their friends about it.  If a manager (or someone interviewing you there) comes up with such a question, then he has never had a chance to develop free software, he hasn’t heard about marketing, and generally gives little attention to sounds that he himself publishes. .  Working with this will not work. </p><br><blockquote>  Sadly, but apparently, a fact: according to my observations, companies are somehow behind popular and large-scale projects. </blockquote><p>  For example, in the form of direct financing of development: if the project is done during working hours, then it is de facto paid.  Yes, yes, even if you have "Friday-for-your-own projects" - what, do you think it is not in the budget?  Or in the form of information support (articles, conferences, videos).  Well, or in the form of support "staff", a la "Vasya, go help Oleg to make a feature in his project."  And this is not to talk about quite frank cases of funding opensource development like EntityFramework or .NET Core, when there are entire departments involved in such projects.  Or all at once (here the conspiracy therapists may ask the question "who benefits from it," but we will come to this). </p><br><p>  To me, from the resources, the company provided only free testing of my work on living people.  And no, I'm not complaining - I myself insisted on it so that all rights and control over the development remain with me.  And for the company with which the contractor relationship has been connecting me for the last 4 years, IT is not so much a core business.  It's awkward to distract people somehow.  In general, the bottom line is as follows: the company treats with understanding, supports morally and provides its system for checking and running the project on live users.  In exchange, it receives the priority right to support and bug fixes, as well as consultations, implementation and staff training.  Bozhechki, I speak in the words of a major integrator, although in my project there are only about 5 thousand lines (without tests). </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Lyrical digression about the help of companies</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p>  Oh, and there was still such an interesting case.  I bought 2015 studio, 2017 Community Edition, but besides that I use JetBrains ReSharper.  And he bought me too.  Among other things, I also have an account on Azure, where for a nominal money there is a simple website with information about me, links to projects and documentation.  So here it is.  JetBrains has <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/buy/opensource/">a</a> free license <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/buy/opensource/">program</a> for open-source developers.  Well, I think - give, zaaplatsya.  Penny, but save.  I will have a gift ReSharper.  Why not?  Wrote, then, a letter to the desired address.  Like so.  I am doing a project like open source.  Give, they say, a license.  The answer is this: </p><br><blockquote>  If you’re meeting your needs, you’ll be able to meet your requirements. <br>  If you’re looking for a program, it’s not worth it. <br>  I can provide you with some commercial services ( <a href="http://www.reinforced-sc.com/Info/Contact">http://www.reinforced-sc.com/Info/Contact</a> ), therefore, project. </blockquote><p> In short, omitting the details.  Essentially, they didn’t like the fact that I wrote on my website (which is visited by 3.5 anonymus) that I’m ready to provide commercial advice and individual commercial support for any of my projects (of two, hehe).  Neither the cost of services, nor any specific conditions - simply, they say, "if you suddenly need it - you write, we agree."  As you understand, proposals, of course, have not been received.  That I am a JetBrains employee and tried to explain in a short correspondence.  In the end, I received the following answer: </p><br><blockquote>  If your project doesn’t provide a license for you. </blockquote><p>  “Well, not a fig for myself” - I thought - “does this mean that I’m supposed to remove from the site information about <em>openness</em> to commercial offers in exchange for $ 200 (the cost of a license for ReSharper) per year? , do not".  And did not continue the dialogue. </p><br><p>  There are, of course, many questions: first, <del>  How much mana from heaven is recommended to use during development so as not to get fat? </del>  If my project is used in the company in which I work, but I develop it in my spare time - is this considered to be the provision of commercial services?  Secondly: <del>  if my project is not used in business - is it useless?  Is JetBrains ready to fund useless projects? </del>  and if I specify my opensource-project in the resume and it increases my chances of being hired - is this also a commercial use?  So maybe it also does not indicate in the summary?  But it also happens that companies support the distributor informationally - is it also money just in a different form?  Need to clarify!  I don't understand anything at all. </p></div></div><br><p>  In general, as you understand, I was confronted with the task of promotion and PR alone.  The very first idea that came to my mind was to write how to use it all.  Here I decided to cheat and combine the useful with the useful - I wrote the first article about RT for Habr (for which a UFO was invited).  The idea was not so much in the "I dodel" -piere, as in how to place on Habré well, at least some Russian-language documentation.  My colleagues are still from Russia, so they needed at least a small manual, but I didn’t want to explain to everyone in a correspondence or voice the same thing.  So the first three articles were born, which were rather coldly received by the audience.  This is understandable - it is unlikely that they were useful to someone from the habr-community, so I don’t worry about it. </p><br><h1 id="o-dokumentacii">  About documentation </h1><br><p>  The idea that it would be nice to give people some knowledge about how to use my framework did not give me rest, until I finally formulated it in this form: </p><br><blockquote>  The documentation is such a thing: it is useless without the project code, and the project code is useless without it. </blockquote><p>  Great idea, except that I knew very little about writing documentation.  In addition to memchiki and jokees about undocumented code, it was clear to the backside that it was necessary to describe verbs for describing methods, and it is not necessary to document designers.  On this my knowledge, perhaps, exhausted.  I folded the <a href="">first version of the README</a> , filled out the project description and began to think. </p><br><p>  How does an amateur approach to writing documentation?  Of course, through doxygen, what else can come up to the programmer?  No sooner said than done.  I set myself the goal of sifting XMLDOC (this is like javadoc, only in C #) so that the build in Release does not give out the wornings "about missing comments for publicly visible members." </p><br><p>К публично-видимым членам компилятор C# относит типы, методы и свойства, видимые "снаружи", при использовании вашей сборки другими пользователями. В общем всё, что не <code>internal</code> и не <code>private</code> в понимании C#. В настоящее время статистика такова: в проекте около 150 публичных типов (всего — около 250), которые содержат суммарно около 700 публичных методов и 260 пропертей. И всё это надо как-то пользователю объяснить. Я приуныл, но сел писать.</p><br>
<p>Через первые 20 задокументированных пропертей я заметил, что мой писательский потенциал как-то поиссяк, а словарный запас поистощился. Как, скажите мне, в одном предложении сформулировать на что влияет поле класса? Желательно при этом не использовать пассивный залог, причастные обороты и громоздкие описания обстоятельств времени. Я зауважал технических писателей. Ребят, правда: берегите технических писателей — у них действительно собачья работа. Меня осенило: можно подсмотреть как решают проблему с пропертями в MSDN! Это действие подарило мне абсолютно дивную словесную конструкцию.</p><br>
<blockquote>Попробуйте начать описание свойства класса со слов "Gets or sets whether..." — каким-то магическим образом концовка сама приходит к вам в голову! </blockquote><p>Словом, стало легче.</p><br>
<p>Через 30 задокументированных классов я начал понимать, что что-то в моём проекте слишком дофига этих самых "публично видимых членов". Процесс документирования был прекращён, код был тщательно проанализирован на предмет того, что пользователю действительно нужно, а без чего пользователь обойдётся. В результате примерно на треть хлама, нуждающегося в документировании, лёг ровным слоем модификатор <code>internal</code> (это как <code>package</code> в Java). Вот как истинные профессионалы решают проблемы с документацией, да! Скрывай лишнее. Словом, стало легче.</p><br>
<p>К моменту, когда примерно половина предупреждений компилятора про комментарии была починена, я почти что впал в депрессию.</p><br>
<blockquote>Выяснилось, что одних лишь стандартизированных комментариев в коде недостаточно! И doxygen не спасёт.</blockquote><p>Дело в том, что в суровой реальности пользователь смотрит на reference-портянку, заботливо сгенерированную doxygen-ом, и видит 150 классов, интерфейсов и enum-ов, которые чёрт ногу сломит как между собой связаны. А запихивать примеры использования в каждый класс и каждый метод — это утопиться ж можно! К завершению написания XMLDOC-а я подошёл в полной уверенности, что без "человеческой" документации обойтись не получится. Внезапно, стало совсем плохо.</p><br>
<p>Покончив с XMLDOC-ом, я решил посмотреть как устроена документация в уже существующих проектах и остановиться на варианте, который мне больше всего бы понравился. Выбор пал на казавшуюся мне дивной документацию к Autofac, сделанную на <a href="https://readthedocs.org/">платформе ReadTheDocs.ord</a>. Меня впечатлил формат reStructuredText. Решение принято, я засел за написание плана документации. И представляете что? Получалась полная фигня. В какой последовательности излагать? Как пользователь будет это читать? Что сначала, что потом? На что откуда должны быть ссылки? Тонна вопросов и вот уже черновики планов летят в урну. </p><br>
<p>Я решил попросить помощи и обратился к замечательному <a href="https://habr.com/users/chebureque/" class="user_link">chebureque</a>, который на ту пору только начинал своё большое дело по оказанию услуг технической документации. Его усилиями мне был выделен студент, желающий познать тайны искусства технического текста. В ходе нескольких недель работы, студент был замучен описаниями и звонками о том, что и как надо писать. Пришло осознание, что проект весьма специфичен и требует знания многих технических деталей. Если я начну их описывать текстом, то… То в итоге это, чёрт побери, и будет документация! А если я буду говорить голосом и контролировать процесс, то на работу, обсуждения, согласования и ревью у нас уйдёт никак не менее полугода. Столько времени и свободных денег на оплату работы студента у меня попросту не было. Так что последний был вознаграждён за месяц усилий и отправлен с миром, да благословением. </p><br>
<blockquote>Я остался один на один с пониманием, что хорошая документация к проекту — это долго и дорого. Сделать её усилиями одного человека за вменяемое время фактически невозможно.</blockquote><p>Закончилась же эта история в лучших традициях: автор психанул, взял встроенную в репозиторий github wiki и просто начал чистым markdown-ом писать то, что ему приходит в голову про проект. Как только всё, что пришло в голову было записано, я переставил блоки текста в последовательности, которая мне кажется правильной, разделил по страницам и вылил в GitHub. Хай будет. Так и живём.</p><br>
<p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wo/nz/9m/wonz9m9mvtf5t6bvbuov8hg0vfo.jpeg" alt="image"></p><br>
<p>Это сейчас я знаю про эту картинку. Но переписывать что-либо, если честно, сил просто нет. Констатирую, что в вопросах документации я-таки сдался. Печально.</p><br>
<h1 id="otsutstvie-polzovateley-i-konferenciya"><del>Отсутствие пользователей и конференция</del></h1><br>
<h1 id="otsutstvie-konferencii-i-polzovateli">Отсутствие конференции и пользователи</h1><br>
<p>Прошло время. Я выпустил ещё 9 версий пакета в NuGet, починил баги, добавил функциональности. Итак, шёл 2016 год и я снова подумал что неплохо было бы рассказать о своём проекте ещё кому-либо. В то время я находился в Эстонии (потому что почему бы и нет?) и меня осенила гениальная идея! </p><br>
<blockquote>А почему бы не сходить на конференцию и не показать там что у меня есть в репозитории? </blockquote><p>Выдача гугла по запросу "european it conferences 2016" озадачила меня. Нигде не говорили про C# и TypeScript. Везде web, мобильные устройства, роботы, криптовалюты, IoT. Темы максимально абстрактные, формулировки максимально широкие. Столько всего, а пойти некуда! Походив по сайтам, почитав анонсы и заголовки, я с удивлением обнаружил, что огромное количество конференций проходят, буквально, "ни о чём". Описания гласили нечто в духе "вызовы бизнесу в эпоху повсеместного Интернета", "облачные технологии в современной экономике", "эволюция коммерции на рубеже веков". Воистину, паранойя и футурология! В названиях прямо читается немая просьба "эй, кто-нибудь, пожалуйста придите и расскажите что же со всеми нами будет!". Но да ладно.</p><br>
<p>Поскитавшись изрядно и почитав всякого, я нашёл неприметную, почти что местячковую конференцию <a href="http://developerdays.pl/">DeveloperDays 2016</a> в Польше. Я написал организаторам и спросил — можно ли? Довольно быстро мне ответил один из организаторов, парень с трудно произосимым именем Кржиштов и сказал что можно. Только, говорит, у нас правило есть — все, кто регистрируется слушателем выбирают по 10 интересующих их спикеров. Пройдёте этот отбор — мы вам и билет подарим, и размещение оплатим. Я отправил описание, с меня так же попросили фотографию, и я стал ждать. Через пару недель молчания в почте, я сделал смелую догадку что меня не выбрали. Написал Кржиштову и тот подтвердил мою догадку. Говорит, ваша тема, к сожалению, заинтересовала только двоих человек. </p><br>
<blockquote>— Не расстраивайтесь — говорит мне Кржиштов — всё равно приходите.<br>
— Ага, щаз! Делать мне не фиг в Краков тащиться! —… думаю я. Но пишу, конечно же — Ничего, всё в порядке. Удачи вам с конференцией.</blockquote><p>Непредвиденные последствия начались после. Счётчик скачиваний в NuGet неожиданно пошёл вверх, а в проект добавилось ажно порядка 10 звёзд. Конечно же, от пользователей с подозрительно польскими именами и удивительно польскими фамилиями. Я бы даже сказал, с катастрофически польскими, потому что эти люди начали создавать issues! Что странно: багов почти не находили. Всё больше просили фич и задавали вопросы, которые не освещались в документации. В итоге, после третьего же бейджика faq, присвоенного очередному закрытому тикету, ко мне пришла, вероятно, самая лучшая маркетинговая стратегия для своего проекта.</p><br>
<blockquote>StackOverflow! Черт побери, это гениально!</blockquote><p>Я зарегистрировался и первым же делом <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12957820/how-to-reuse-existing-c-sharp-class-definitions-in-typescript-projects">пошёл</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36154235/end-to-end-type-safety-of-json-between-c-sharp-and-typescript">и</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26238455/typelite-poco-class-generation">нашёл</a> целых три вопроса про экспорт C#-классов в TypeScript, на которые незамедлительно и ответил наглым самопиаром. И о чудо — моим ответам поставили плюсики! В срочном порядке был <a href="">переписан README</a> на более доходчивый, а чуть позже была добавлена секция Support policy. Там было указано что отныне все вопросы принимаются на StackOverflow по определённому хэштегу, о создании которого я попросил одного из пришедших пользователей. Потому что ну реально удобный формат для хранения FAQ. На хэштег я подписался через RSS и с энтузиазмом приступил к этапу поддержки проекта.</p><br>
<h1 id="podderzhka">Поддержка</h1><br>
<p>После того, как RT засветился на StackOverflow — в проект начали медленно, но верно течь звёзды. При том от людей из абсолютно разных мест и компаний! В списке stargazers отметились люди из Barclays и Microsoft. Географически же звёзды приходили из разных уголков мира — США, Дания, Германия, Румыния, Канада, Австралия… И даже Беларусь! По секрету скажу, что одно время в Insights было видно, что за некоторыми страницам документации упорно наблюдают из JIRA какой-то американской компании.</p><br>
<p>На StackOverflow же я получил несколько вопросов, на которые оперативно ответил, за что был вознаграждён плюсиками и репутацией. Приятно. В issues периодически приходили багрепорты, которые я старался более-менее оперативно чинить. Неприятно. В какой-то момент в проекте появились тесты. Я естественным путём пришёл к их необходимости, не пытаясь покрыть тестами что-либо заранее. Это простенькие, но гордые регрессионные тесты, в которых я воспроизводил присланные баги (к сожалению, не все — по техническим причинам) и чинил, закрывая баг ссылкой на тест. </p><br>
<blockquote>TDD — удобно, но только с определённого этапа и только для контроля регрессии.</blockquote><p>И знаете — люди-таки приятно удивляются, когда их баг во фреймворке более-менее оперативно фиксится. Это ясно из лайков и коротких, но душевных благодарностей вроде</p><br>
<p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ak/s5/ft/aks5ftfxjbrmpimgwdahthizsok.png" alt="image"></p><br>
<p>Было получено несколько небольших, но хороших пулл-реквестов. Почти все они были смерджены в мастер (пусть и с изменениями), что прибавило проекту контрибьюторов — их уже целых 10, хотя 99% кода по-прежнему остаётся за мной. </p><br>
<p>Самые большие проблемы поддержки были с несколькими конфликтующими фич-реквестами, а так же с тем, что как C# так и TypeScript довольно быстро меняются. Экосистема развивается настолько быстро, что я буквально не успеваю выкатывать обновления!</p><br>
<blockquote>За время существования RT, успел уйти dnx, появится .NET Standard, пройти 3 релиза .NET Core, выйти около 20 релизов TypeScript и под всё это добро мне приходилось оперативно выпускать апдейты, чтобы не выпасть из тренда.</blockquote><p>А вчера я узнал, что один из фреймворков-конкурентов до сих пор не выпустил поддержку .NET Core :)</p><br>
<h1 id="i-vot-ya-zdes">И вот я здесь</h1><br>
<p>Ощущения, как ни странно, тревожные. Несмотря на все получаемые благодарности, поддерживать такой проект и обратную связь с пользователям довольно сложно (кто бы мог подумать!). Да, я делаю полезное дело, но… мне-то это зачем? Да, это опыт: опыт общения с аудиторией, написания документации, несения публичной ответственности, планирования. Технический опыт в конце концов (сдался мне этот .NET Core, да купила баба порося). Однако что это даёт помимо опыта? Если честно, то ничего. </p><br>
<p>За последние 3 года никто этим проектом не интересовался помимо его непосредственных пользователей. Работодатели? Рекрутёры? Пха! Не смешите мои тапки. Ссылка на проект торчит во всех профилях, но не упоминается ни в одном письме с предложением о работе. Как будто его не существует. А отдельные индивиды даже просили меня приложить к резюме пример кода zip-архивом — вот настолько у ссылок на GitHub развит навык мимикрии и невидимости! В общем, приготовьтесь к тому, что в карьерном плане небольшой, но живой OSS-проект вам не особо-то поможет.</p><br>
<blockquote>Что даёт opensource-проект своему автору? Да на самом деле почти ничего. </blockquote><p>Зачем же тогда?<br>
Я могу понять зачем OSS нужен компаниям: они таким образом поднимают себе репутацию на ровном месте (opensource как форма публичной благотворительности) и увеличивают доступность своих технологий для потенциальных пользователей (повышают охват). Показателен интерес Microsoft к OSS — через .NET Core и "Microsoft loves Linux" активно привлекаются пользователи на MS-инфраструктуру, в которой немало интересных коммерческих продуктов — Azure в частности. И как по мне — имеют право! Цель благородная, средства законные. </p><br>
<p>Компании зарабатывают на opensource. Да-да, вот например <a href="https://www.percona.com/">Percona</a> берёт mysql, собирает кастомные билды, фиксит баги и допиливает фичи "под заказчика". Иногда, разумеется, и в сам mysql коммитит, и на вопросы отвечает. Но в основном продаёт свою экспертизу в области использования mysql для ваших тёмных делишек.</p><br>
<p>Бесчисленное множество разнокалиберных интеграторов, а так же мелких системных администраторов не гнушаются продавать свои услуги по установке и настройке OSS-программного обеспечения, скажем, для офисных нужд. И это — их хлеб с маслом: во многих OSS-проектах даже с документацией чёрт ногу сломит, а эти вроде как разбираются. Правда, за денежку.</p><br>
<p>Так же используют OSS, внезапно, и для политических целей — я слышал историю о том, что, якобы, через разработку Apache Harmony, ныне почивший Sun Microsystems принуждали открыть исходники JRE (могу ошибаться, слухи всё-таки).</p><br>
<p>Я могу понять зачем OSS нужен сотрудникам компаний, если такую деятельность компании готовы оплачивать. Делов-то — убедить босса в том, что занимаешься очень полезным делом, "делаешь мир лучше" — и готово. Можно получать зарплату и самому себе ставить задачи. Компания же может использовать этот проект для технопиара — показать, мол, "смотрите как удобно работается в нашей компании — сотрудники <del>от безделия</del> ажно свои проекты создают, а мы открыты к идеям" и т.п. И такую версию событий слышал.</p><br>
<p>Я могу понять зачем OSS нужен молодым разработчикам — получить промышленный международный опыт, показать себя. Здесь лучший вариант — выбрать какой-нибудь существующий проект и основательно в него покоммитить. Поучаствовать в обсуждениях, войти в user group, community, поотвечать на вопросы, пооказывать поддержку. С таким опытом хорошо идти на собеседование в серьёзные компании — будешь знать что примерно происходит в живой разработке, интереснее отвечать на вопросы на собеседовании. Да и английский попрактикуешь в конце-то концов. Можно гордо повесить на себя бейджик "member of <em>something</em> user group, contributor".</p><br>
<p>Сделать же большой и сколько-нибудь известный OSS-проект самому, с нуля, <em>в современных реалиях</em> практически невозможно, как мне кажется. Именно поэтому я называю свой опыт дилетантским.</p><br>
<blockquote>И дело вовсе не в том, что вы — плохой программист. Нет, программист вы, скорее всего, честный и хороший. А вот маркетолог, сотрудник техподдержки и технический писатель в одном лице — скорее всего нет. </blockquote><p>Для того, чтобы проект всерьёз работал на ваши карьерные и рекламные цели, вам нужно построить вокруг него заметных размеров community. А чтобы его построить — нужны или деньги, или огромное количество времени и сил, которыми, опять же, у вас нет возможности разбрасываться — иначе у вас станет существенно меньше денег и, как следствие, еды в холодильнике.</p><br>
<p>Мне кажется, что единственное место, где бесплатные продукты, сделанные одиночками с нуля действительно ждёт целевая аудитория — это, пожалуй, linux. Особенно дивный мир "настольного" Linux. Система не то чтобы сильно популярная, много чего из программного обеспечения нет — вот пользователи и рады любой разработке. Однако уже и туда компании принесли свои ресурсы и деньги. Вообще как-то даже обидно, что из "творческого порыва", смелого экспериментаторства и возможности самореализации для разработчиков, opensource превратился в один из инструментов ведения бизнеса и маркетинга для компаний. Но рынок есть рынок. В конце концов деньги потрачены, результаты есть. Без такой помощи открытому ПО было бы гораздо хуже, чем есть сейчас. </p><br>
<p>Но давайте просто будем честными. Если какая-то коммерческая структура заявляет, что она-де "поддерживает opensource", подразумевая повышенную духовную чистоту и благодетель — это в большинстве случаев наглая ложь и передёргивание. </p><br>
<blockquote>Компании не делают то, что им не выгодно. </blockquote><p>Поддерживая opensource, компании как бы входят в "воображаемый уставной капитал" и сохраняют за собой право использовать побочные эффекты спонсируемой opensource-разработки в своих целях — будь то маркетинг, или прямая монетизация. Из этого следует</p><br>
<blockquote>Тревожный вывод: полезность OSS-проекта для целевых пользователей и полезность OSS-проекта для спонсирующей его компании — вещи зачастую диаметрально противоположные. И печальная реальность такова, что для успешности проекту нужно быть полезным прежде всего для своего спонсора. А не для пользователей. </blockquote><p>Нет, я не призываю, разумеется, к коммунистической революции, "отнять и поделить" и "изгнать всю коммерцию из opensource". Я призываю снять розовые очки и не думать, что если компания поддерживает OSS, то это безвозмездная забота об индустрии и делается от большой доброты душевной. Вовсе нет. Я бы сказал, что компании выгодно вкладывать копеечку при условии, что её уши будут торчать из проекта во все стороны. И в этом нет никакой благотворительности. Как только это условие нарушается, компания теряет к проекту всяческий интерес. А если интерес есть, то будьте уверены — компания свой гешефт получит. Но получите ли его вы? Вот в чём вопрос...</p><br>
<p>Ладно, будем прощаться. Напоследок я приведу некоторые цифры о своём проекте:</p><br>

<li>около 5000 строк кода, 225 классов, 1428 методов, 380 пропертей;</li>
<li>43 релиза выпущено;</li>
<li>84 issues закрыто;</li>
<li>10 контрибьюторов;</li>
<li>107 звёзд;</li>
