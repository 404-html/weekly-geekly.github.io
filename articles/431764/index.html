It seems that the party after which the driver followed home was a success, as the police tried to wake the man for about seven minutes.  During this time, the vehicle managed to drive about 13 kilometers. <br><br>  Only after this, Tesla stopped, the driver woke up and the police managed to solve this problem.  Alexander Samek, the owner of Tesla, drew the attention of the police - they noticed that he was just sleeping, and his Tesla followed the highway at a speed of about 112 km / h.  Despite the fact that the electric car was controlled by the autopilot, this whole situation was extremely dangerous both for the driver and for other road users. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In this case, the driver did not wake up even when the police came close to the electric car with the sirens turned on.  It was possible to stop the car only through direct contact, when the Tesla computer rated the situation as dangerous and stopped. <br><br>  "One of our officers overtook the car and began to slow down, which affected the reaction of the autopilot - he stopped the car," - said in a police report. <br><br>  The driver was arrested because he was driving an electric vehicle while intoxicated.  He failed the test, there was too much alcohol in the blood.  It is possible that the Tesla autopilot (and his work during the incident still needs to be proved) saved the life of the driver. <br><br>  The police after this incident stated that they are, in principle, pleased that such technology as robomobils is becoming more common.  But they remind the owners of such machines of the need to control themselves - so far the autopilot has not achieved absolute autonomy and this is unlikely to happen in the next few years. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/431764/">https://habr.com/ru/post/431764/</a></p>
