  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Top 3 Mobile Software Security Testing Innovators</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  On December 19, 2018, IDC analytical agency published a report from <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp%3FcontainerId%3DUS44506918">IDC Innovators: Mobile App Security Testing, 2018</a> , in which it presented three innovators from 2018, offering mobile application security testing solutions (Mobile App Security Testing - MAST).  These companies are High-Tech Bridge, Kryptowire and NowSecure. </p><br><p>  Mobile software developers (as well as any other software) are not immune from errors, so numerous codes of mobile applications often reveal holes that make them vulnerable to user data theft or unauthorized use.  Manual verification of software code is too time-consuming for many programmers and development companies, and, moreover, is also subject to human error. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oo/cg/hc/oocghceww39-bdrnvnrn7o3ua7u.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  Innovations in the field of testing the security of mobile and embedded applications today are artificial intelligence (AI) and various tools to automate the code testing process.  All this allows even at the stage of application development to reduce the risks of their hacking and make them more secure, and also greatly reduce the time to check the code and, of course, the overall development time. </p><br><p>  ‚ÄúThe creators of testing software will go far if they prove that using artificial intelligence reduces the number of false positives when detecting mobile application vulnerabilities or detects unusual vulnerabilities before they cause damage to application users, companies and brands in the market,‚Äù said Denise Lund, CTO. Enterprise Mobility Research at IDC. </p><br><h2 id="kompanii-innovatory-2018">  Innovation Companies 2018 </h2><br><p>  Traditionally, IDC Innovators reports are compiled for different sectors of the market, while for each of them a large number of companies (but not all) are considered with annual revenues of less than $ 100 million at the time of selection for the survey.  In the process of preparing these reports, IDC analysts study companies offering innovative technologies, an innovative approach to the existing problem and / or a new business model in a particular market.  Such companies in the report <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp%3FcontainerId%3DUS44506918">IDC Innovators: Mobile App Security Testing, 2018</a> - High-Tech Bridge, Kryptowire and NowSecure. </p><br><p>  <a href="https://www.htbridge.com/">High-Tech Bridge</a> uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to check the security and privacy of mobile applications.  This solution uses the data obtained at the stages of previous application tests and real-life use cases, as well as manual testing in difficult cases, in order to reduce the number of false positives. </p><br><p>  <a href="https://www.kryptowire.com/">Kryptowire</a> offers technologies that test software for mobile devices (including firmware) and embedded software for IoT devices for compliance with international security and privacy standards.  This allows you to effectively increase the level of software security, eliminating the detected vulnerabilities at the programming stage. </p><br><p>  <a href="https://www.nowsecure.com/">NowSecure</a> offers a solution for automatically testing the security of a mobile application - the system itself embeds the real attack code into the file of the application under test for its dynamic and behavioral testing.  Due to the frequent update of AI in NowSecure solutions, their use can effectively replace testers. </p><br><p>  <i>Article prepared on the basis of the <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp%3FcontainerId%3DprUS44565318">IDC press release.</a></i> </p></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/434268/">https://habr.com/ru/post/434268/</a></p>
