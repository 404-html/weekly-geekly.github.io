Then interruptions of iron were added to it.  Now you can effectively use slow and unpredictable devices. </p><br><p>  With the increasing capabilities of iron and its low availability, there is a need to perform several tasks at the same time, which provided hardware support.  This is how isolated processes with abstracted from iron interruptions in the form of signals appeared. </p><br><p>  The next evolutionary stage was multithreading, which was implemented on the foundation of the same processes, but with shared access to memory and other resources.  This approach has its limitations and significant overhead for switching to a secure OS. </p><br><p>  To communicate between processes and even different machines, a Promise / Future abstraction was proposed 40+ years ago. </p><br><p>  User interfaces and the now ridiculous problem of 10K clients led to the heyday of Event Loop, Reactor and Proactor approaches, which are more event-oriented than clear, consistent business logic. </p><br><p>  Finally, we arrived at a modern coroutine (coroutine), which is essentially an emulation of threads on top of the abstractions described above with the corresponding technical limitations and deterministic transfer of control. </p><br><p>  For the transfer of events, results and exceptions all returned to the same concept of Promise / Future.  Some offices have decided to call a little differently - "Task". </p><br><p> Ultimately, everything was hidden in a beautiful <code>async/await</code> package, which requires support from the compiler or translator, depending on the technology. </p><br><h3 id="problemy-s-tekuschiy-situaciy-asinhronnoy-biznes-logiki">  Problems with current situations asynchronous business logic </h3><br><p>  Consider only coroutines and Promise, decorated with <code>async/await</code> , because  the existence of problems in older approaches confirms the evolution process itself. </p><br><p>  These two terms are not identical.  For example, in ECMAScript there are no coroutines, but there are syntactic facilitations for using <code>Promise</code> , which in turn only organizes work with the hell of callbacks (callback hell).  In fact, scripting engines like V8 go further and make special optimizations for pure <code>async/await</code> functions and calls. </p><br><p>  The experts' statements about <code>co_async/co_await</code> not included in C ++ 17 are <a href="https://habr.com/post/278267/">here on the resource</a> , but by the pressure of the software giant, coroutines can appear in the standard exactly in their form.  In the meantime, the traditional recognized solution is <a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_68_0/libs/context/doc/html/index.html">Boost.Context</a> , <a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_68_0/libs/coroutine2/doc/html/index.html">Boost.Fiber</a> and <a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_68_0/libs/coroutine2/doc/html/index.html">Boost.Coroutine2</a> . </p><br><p>  In Java, there is still no <code>async/await</code> at the language level, but there are solutions like <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/ea-async">EA Async</a> , which, like Boost.Context, need to be customized for each version of JVM and byte code. </p><br><p>  Go has its coroutines, but if you look carefully at the articles and bug reports of open projects, it turns out that everything is not so smooth.  Perhaps the loss of the coroutine interface as a managed entity is not the best idea. </p><br><h4 id="mnenie-avtora-soprogrammy-na-golom-zheleze-opasny">  Opinion of the author: coroutines on bare gland are dangerous </h4><br><p>  Personally, the author has very little against coroutines in dynamic languages, but he is extremely wary of any flirting with the machine code level stack. </p><br><p>  A few theses: </p><br><ol><li>  It is required to allocate a stack: <br><ul><li>  the stack on the heap has a number of flaws: problems of timely detection of overflow, damage by neighbors and other reliability / safety problems, </li><li>  a protected stack requires at least one page of physical memory, one conditional page, and additional overhead for each call to the <code>async</code> function: 4 + KB (minimum) + increased system limits, </li><li>  in the end, it may be that a significant part of the memory allocated for stacks is not used during the coroutine's idle time. </li></ul></li><li>  It is necessary to implement complex logic for saving, restoring and deleting the state of coroutines: <br><ul><li>  for each case of processor architecture (even models) and binary interface (ABI): <a href="https://github.com/boostorg/context/tree/develop/src/asm">an example</a> </li><li>  New or optional architecture features introduce potentially latent problems (for example, Intel TSX, ARM or MIPS co-processors), </li><li>  other potential problems due to proprietary systems proprietary documentation (Boost documentation refers to this). </li></ul></li><li>  Potential problems with dynamic analysis tools and security in general: <br><ul><li>  for example, integration with Valgrind is required due to the same skipping stacks, </li><li>  It's hard to speak for antiviruses, but they probably don't really like it using the example of problems with the JVM in the past, </li><li>  I am sure that new types of attacks will appear and vulnerabilities associated with the implementation of coroutines will be revealed. </li></ul></li></ol><br><h4 id="mnenie-avtora-generatory-i-yield-principialnoe-zlo">  Opinion of the author: generators and <code>yield</code> fundamental evil </h4><br><p>  This seemingly third-party topic is directly related to the concept of coroutines and the "continue" property. </p><br><p>  In short, for any collection there should be a full-fledged iterator.  Why create the problem of a truncated iterator generator is not clear.  For example, a case with <code>range()</code> in Python is more like an exclusive showcase than an excuse for technical complication. </p><br><p>  If the case of an infinite generator, then the logic of its implementation is elementary.  Why create additional technical difficulties to shove an infinite continuous cycle inside? </p><br><p>  The only efficient later appeared justification, which supporters of coroutines bring, is all kind of stream parsers with control inverting.  In fact, this is a narrow specialized case for solving single problems of the library level, and not the business logic of applications.  At the same time, there is an elegant, simple and more descriptive solution through finite automata.  The area of ​​these technical problems is much smaller than the area of ​​banal business logic. </p><br><p>  In fact, the solved problem turns out to be sucked from the finger and requires a relatively serious effort for initial implementation and long-term support.  To the extent that some projects may prohibit the use of computer-code coroutines, following the example of a ban on <code>goto</code> or the use of dynamic memory allocation in certain industries. </p><br><h4 id="mnenie-avtora-model-asyncawait-na-promise-iz-ecmascript-bolee-nadyozhna-no-trebuet-adaptacii">  Opinion of the author: <code>async/await</code> model on Promise from ECMAScript is more reliable, but requires adaptation </h4><br><p>  Unlike the continuing coroutines, in this model, pieces of code are secretly divided into uninterrupted blocks, decorated in the form of anonymous functions.

Perhaps a more serious problem is data locality and efficient use of the processor cache. </p><br><p>  On the first problem: prioritization at the level of individual coroutines looks like a big overhead.  Instead, they can be operated in common for a particular unified task.  So come with traffic flows. </p><br><p>  This is possible by creating separate instances of the Event Loop with its own “iron” streams and planning at the OS level.  The second option is to synchronize the coroutines with respect to the primitive (Mutex, Throttle) that limits the competition and / or performance. </p><br><p>  Asynchronous programming does not make the processor resources rubber and requires absolutely normal restrictions on the number of simultaneously processed tasks and the limit on the total execution time. </p><br><p>  Protection against long-term blocking on one coroutine requires the same measures as with callbacks — to avoid blocking system calls and long data processing cycles. </p><br><p>  The second problem requires research, but at a minimum the coroutine stacks themselves and the details of the Future / Promise implementation already violate the data locality.  It is possible to try to continue the execution of the same coroutine if Future already matters.  It requires some mechanism for counting the runtime or the number of such continuations to prevent one coroutine from capturing the entire processor time.  This may either not give a result, or give a very double result depending on the size of the processor cache and the number of threads. </p><br><p>  There is also a third point - many implementations of coroutine planners allow you to run them on different processor cores, which, on the contrary, adds problems due to the mandatory synchronization when accessing shared resources.  In the case of a single Event Loop stream, such synchronization is required only at the logic level, since  Each synchronous callback unit is guaranteed to work without a race with others. </p><br><h4 id="mnenie-avtora-vsyo-horosho-v-meru">  Opinion of the author: everything is good in moderation </h4><br><p>  The presence of threads in modern operating systems does not negate the use of separate processes.  Also, processing a large number of clients in the Event Loop does not cancel the use of separate "iron" streams for other needs. </p><br><p>  In any case, coroutines and various variants of Event Loops complicate the debugging process without the necessary support in the tools, and with local variables on the coroutine stack, everything becomes even more difficult - they can hardly be reached. </p><br><hr><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2p/pp/lb/2ppplbzrvm8c0yvbasdwrojknss.png" width="326" height="326"></div><br><h2 id="futoin-asyncsteps---alternativa-soprogrammam">  FutoIn AsyncSteps - alternative to coroutines </h2><br><p>  We take as a basis the already well-established Event Loop pattern and the organization of the ECMAScript (JavaScript) Promise callback scheme. </p><br><p>  From the point of view of planning the execution, we are interested in the following actions from the Event Loop: </p><br><ol><li>  Immediate callback <code>Handle immediate(callack)</code> with the requirement of a clean call stack. </li><li>  Deferred callback <code>Handle deferred(delay, callback)</code> . </li><li>  Cancel callback <code>handle.cancel()</code> . </li></ol><br><p>  So we get an interface called <code>AsyncTool</code> , which can be implemented in a variety of ways, including over existing proven developments.  He has no direct relation to writing business logic, so we will not go into further details. </p><br><h3 id="derevo-shagov">  Step tree: </h3><br><p>  In the concept of AsyncSteps, an abstract tree of synchronous steps is built and is executed by a depth passage in the creation sequence.  The steps of each deeper level are dynamically set as such a passage is completed. </p><br><p>  All interaction takes place through a single interface <code>AsyncSteps</code> , which is conventionally passed as the first parameter in each step.  According to the convention, the name of the parameter is <code>asi</code> or obsolete <code>as</code> .  Such an approach makes it possible to almost completely break the link between a specific implementation and the writing of business logic in plug-ins and libraries. </p><br><p>  In canonical implementations, each step receives its own copy of an object that implements <code>AsyncSteps</code> , which allows timely tracking of logical errors in the use of the interface. </p><br><p>

Это избегает проблемы асинхронного выполнения тяжёлых задач, результат которых уже не требуется. Это аналог RAII и <code>atexit()</code> в традиционном программировании. </p><br><p> <strong>Непосредственно отмена выполнения <code>cancel()</code></strong> — типично используется при отсоединении клиента, истечения максимального срока выполнения запроса или иных причин завершения. Это аналог <code>SIGTERM</code> или <code>pthread_cancel()</code> , оба из которых весьма специфичны в реализации. </p><br><p> <strong>Таймеры отмены шага <code>setTimeout()</code></strong> — типично используется для ограничения общего времени выполнения запроса и для ограничения времени ожидания подзапросов и внешних событий. Действуют на всё поддерево, выкидывает перехватываемую ошибку "Timeout". </p><br><p> <strong>Интеграция с другими технологиями асинхронного программирования</strong> — использование FutoIn AsyncSteps не требует отказываться от уже используемых технологий и не требует разработки новых библиотек. </p><br><p> <strong>Универсальная реализация на уровне конкретного языка программирования</strong> — нет необходимости в специфичных и потенциально опасных с изменениями ABI манипуляциях на уровне машинного кода, которые требуются для сопрограмм.

Используются версии Node.js v8.12.0 и v10.11.0, установленные через <a href="https://futoin.org/docs/cid/">FutoIn CID</a> . </p><br><table><thead><tr><th> Tech </th><th> Simple </th><th> Loop </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> <strong>Node.js v10</strong> </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td> FutoIn AsyncSteps </td><td> <strong>1342899.520Hz</strong> </td><td> 587.777Hz </td></tr><tr><td> async/await </td><td> 524983.234Hz </td><td> <strong>630.863Hz</strong> </td></tr><tr><td> <strong>Node.js v8</strong> </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td> FutoIn AsyncSteps </td><td> <strong>682420.735Hz</strong> </td><td> <strong>588.336Hz</strong> </td></tr><tr><td> async/await </td><td> 365050.395Hz </td><td> 400.575Hz </td></tr></tbody></table><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x7/-n/b5/x7-nb5v9dfkwn1lttyg67w2b_tk.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gh/yj/9p/ghyj9pczw0smbfksq-aad_tltay.png"></div><br><p> <em>Больше — лучше.</em> </p><br><p> Внезапный разгром <code>async/await</code> ? Да, но в V8 для Node.js v10 подтянули оптимизацию циклов и стало чуть лучше. </p><br><p> Стоит добавить, что реализация Promise и <code>async/await</code> <strong>блокирует</strong> Node.js Event Loop. Бесконечный цикл без ожидания внешнего события попросту повесит процесс ( <a href="https://gist.github.com/andvgal/14e745405c3cb7d14bd91ab0530ce8ca">пруф</a> ), но с FutoIn AsyncSteps такого не случается. </p><br><p> <em>Периодический выход из AsyncSteps в Node.js Event Loop и есть причина ложной победы <code>async/await</code> в тесте-цикле на Node.js v10.</em> </p><br><p> <em>Оговорюсь, что сравнивать показатели производительности с С++ будет некорректно — разная реализация методологии тестирования. Для приближения, результаты тестирования циклов Node.js нужно умножить на 10 тыс.</em> </p><br><h3 id="vyvody">  findings </h3><br><p> На примере C++, FutoIn AsyncSteps и Boost.Fiber показывают схожую длительную производительность и потребление памяти, а вот на запуске Boost.Fiber серьёзно проигрывает и ограничен системными лимитами по количеству <code>mmap()/mprotect</code> . </p><br><p> Максимальная производительность зависит от эффективного использования кэша, но в реальной жизни данные бизнес-логики могут оказывать большее давление на кэш, чем реализация сопрограмм. Вопрос полноценного планировщика остаётся открытым. </p><br><p> FutoIn AsyncSteps для JavaScript превосходит <code>async/await</code> в производительности даже в последней версии Node.js v10. </p><br><p> В конечном счёте, основная нагрузка должна быть непосредственно от бизнес-логики, а не от реализации концепции асинхронного программирования. Поэтому незначительные отклонения не должны быть существенным аргументом. </p><br><p> Разумно написанная бизнес-логика внедряет асинхронные переходы только когда подразумевается ожидание внешнего события в любом виде или когда объём обрабатываемых данных слишком велик и на долго блокирует "железный" поток выполнения. Исключение из этого правила — написание библиотечных API. </p><br><hr><br><h2 id="zaklyuchenie">  Conclusion </h2><br><p> Принципиально, интерфейс FutoIn AsyncSteps проще, понятнее и более функционален чем любые из конкурентов без "сахара" <code>async/await</code> . Вдобавок, он реализован стандартными средствами и унифицирован для всех технологий. Как и в случае с <code>Promise</code> из ECMAScript, AsyncSteps может получить свой "сахар" и его поддержку в компиляторах или средах выполнения практически любого языка. </p><br><p> Замеры производительности не сильно оптимизированной реализации показывают сравнимые и даже превосходящие результаты относительно альтернативных технологий. Гибкость возможной реализации доказана двумя разными подходами AsyncSteps и NitroSteps для единого интерфейса. </p><br><p> Помимо уже указанной выше <a href="https://specs.futoin.org/final/preview/ftn12_async_api.html">спецификации</a> , есть ориентированная на разработчика-пользователя <a href="https://futoin.org/docs/asyncsteps/">документация</a> . </p><br><p> По запросам возможна реализация версии для Java/JVM или любого другого языка с адекватными анонимными функциями — иначе читаемость кода падает. Любая помощь проекту приветствуется. </p><br><p> Если вам действительно нравится такая альтернатива, то не стесняйтесь поставить звёздочки на <a href="https://github.com/futoin%3Fq%3Dcore-cpp">GitHub</a> и/или <a href="https://gitlab.com/futoin/core/cpp">GitLab</a> . </p></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/424311/">https://habr.com/ru/post/424311/</a></p>
