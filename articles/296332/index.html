In general, we train and understand why it is better to keep some phrases with you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7aa/5d3/1d0/7aa5d31d05814cf88abe8ce0120043f2.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fcd/c34/ec3/fcdc34ec3c8e4cb3aff3aaf9a1fe3e7d.jpg"><br><br>  <b>// "I'm so excited"</b> <br>  HR-manager is well aware of this.  You do not need to show your emotions - this is not very professional. <br><br>  <b>// "And what are you doing here?"</b> <br>  Have you not completed your homework?  Oh, you!  Be sure to get information about the company, to see what is on the site and, even more importantly, on social networks - explore and will feel more confident. <br><br>  <b>// "I can do anything"</b> <br>  What's this?  Do not you five years at the university received a profession?  Or just hopelessness tormented?  In any case, try on the contrary to designate the sphere of your competence and clearly define what you can do, what you do well and how you relate yourself to the proposed position.  And then become the "king of the office coffee machines."  And who needs it? <br><br>  <b>// "I do not have work experience"</b> <br>  "‚Ä¶ but I have..." <br>  Do not immediately burn bridges!  Lack of experience can be a big plus if you apply yourself correctly.  Are you a person who has not yet been squeezed by a company or an enormous responsibility - do you have a lot of initiative and inspiration to create?  Show it! <br><br>  <b>// "Can I work from home?"</b> <br>  If it were possible, then this would be mentioned when writing a vacancy.  So try to postpone this question.  Do you need a job or an opportunity to be at home?  The point is priorities. <br><br>  <b>// "I dont know"</b> <br>  Do not give up.  This answer shows that you give up and do not even try to find ways to solve the problem.  Never answer like that if you don‚Äôt want to look like an insecure person and specialist.  It is better to say "I think that ..." and make a mistake than "not knowing." <br><br>  <b>// "I have a hard time"</b> <br>  Firstly, it doesn‚Äôt care about the company you came to - they are looking for a person who can work at any time and develop.  This may be perceived as pressure or depression.  And that, and that is bad.  Secondly, we all sometimes read the news.  And all of us will have hard times after this.  Gathered and more.  The world does not stand still. <br><br>  <b>// "Sorry for being late!"</b> <br>  Not.  Do not be late!  Just do not be late. <br><br>  <b>// "How fast can you achieve promotion?"</b> <br>  Do you think immediately after the interview you will increase?  Hardly.  The question is good, but we'll ask it later when we get settled. <br><br>  <b>// "I want to create my own business"</b> <br>  This is a contradiction - why did you come for an interview?  Or do you warn that you will soon disappear?  No one will be happy about it. <br><br>  <b>// "I do not have any questions"</b> <br>  Catch <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/51-vopros-kotoryj-vy-mozhete-zadat-na-intervyu/">this stuff about the questions you need to ask after the interview</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296332/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296332/</a></p>
