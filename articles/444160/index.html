  <section class="page js-page"><h1>[Habr]: About the "glass ceiling"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  And today, friends, as the name implies, we will talk about some trends that are to blame ... ourselves. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  How expensive the community finds is the fact that here and now on our favorite portal it creates a ‚Äúglass ceiling‚Äù according to many trends in modern engineering and, in fact, hinders its own development at the level of ‚Äújust an inexperienced beginner‚Äù , for one and all, none other than the community itself? <br><br>  Itself.  And just myself. <br><br>  And, quite obviously, this is all created mainly by teenage-emotional behavioral models - without regard to the general trends in the development of the portal / community / professional areas. <br><br>  So that the statements above do not seem unfounded - a small example. <br><br>  Please see the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/sith/" class="user_link">sith</a> user <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/sith/" class="user_link">account</a> . <br><br>  If you go to the section of his publications, you will see that he is a very active author who generates articles that are incredibly commented on and, accordingly, cause an active public discussion, coverage of additional topics and general vigor of communication. <br><br>  That is - exactly what is required for the healthy development of the community and the portal.  And also that brings income.  Money to the portal holders. <br><br>  After all, you do not forget that everything around us is not just like that, but it is necessary to maintain / develop / pay staff salaries / provide computing power and storage space, etc.? <br><br>  Personally, I often disagree with the opinion of the aforementioned interlocutor - but this is precisely his opinion, which leads to an interesting discussion and also makes the ‚Äúvariegated blanket‚Äù necessary for the normal evolution of the system ( <i>here you can write a lot more, mention Voltaire / Evelynn Hall, etc., etc. - but laziness</i> :). <br><br>  That is, we have a most curious situation where everything at once, it seems, is always for everything good and against all bad things - with a burning, inquiring mind attached to this ardent heart, a look ... <br><br>  But then, dear community, please explain to me how it turns out that you, in some of your weighty and active part, behave like an extremely touchy and notorious individual, joyfully shoot yourself in the foot, cut out the sea - and first of all cut yourself off Is it a vector of development and evolution of a healthy person?  ;) <br><br>  PS Perhaps you ask, and where is the career? <br><br>  And everything is very simple: career depends not least on the relationship between people.  And this: productive interaction, regardless of personal emotions - this should be regularly learned, learn, learn. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/444160/">https://habr.com/ru/post/444160/</a></p>
