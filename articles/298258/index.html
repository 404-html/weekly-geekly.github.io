Dollars in the US</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1fe/9a4/bce/1fe9a4bce73d4118b94af47784d28096.jpg"><br><br>  The well-known resource Dice.com, dedicated to the labor market and job search, recently <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/salaries-bonuses-and-contract-rates-jump-for-us-technology-professionals-300209544.html">published the</a> results of a survey conducted in the USA in the autumn of 2015, in which 16,301 people participated with IT professions.  As a result of the survey, a list of average salaries was created for people with certain skills in demand in the industry.  But do not forget that to get a good job with a decent salary, some skills may not be enough - you also need experience. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>10. Puppet - the average salary is 131,121 dollars a year.</b> <br>  Puppet is IT automation software from Puppet Labs, one of the many young companies that are part of a huge trend in the technology world, called DevOps.  This is one of the methods of software development, in which software developers and a team of information and technical support staff use special techniques to enable the rapid deployment of technology. <br><br>  <b>9. MapReduce - the average salary is 131,563 dollars per year.</b> <br>  MapReduce is a distributed computing model that is used to analyze huge amounts of data in computer clusters. <br><br>  <b>8. Pig - the average salary is 132,850 dollars a year.</b> <br>  The Pig tool, which is very much in demand nowadays, is a programming language and a runtime environment for running scripts.  This tool allows you to get information from Hadoop, find answers to questions and use available information. <br><br>  <b>7. Chef - the average salary is 136,850 dollars a year.</b> <br>  Chef is IT automation software that is part of the DevOps trend mentioned above.  Chef is a competitor to Puppet. <br><br>  <b>6. CloudStack - the average salary is $ 138.095 per year.</b> <br>  Cloud computing is another trend.  In the IT world is a struggle of cloud operating systems.  Some of them are open source, one such example is CloudStack, software for building, managing and deploying a cloud services infrastructure created by Citrix and currently owned by the Apache Software Foundation. <br><br>  <b>5. OpenStack - the average salary is 138,579 dollars a year.</b> <br>  Another free open source cloud operating system.  It is supported by many developers, including IBM, HP, Red Hat, Ubuntu and many others. <br><br>  <b>4. PaaS - the average salary is 140,894 dollars per year.</b> <br>  PaaS is a “platform as a service” that allows developers to build applications in the cloud.  The Microsoft Azure cloud computing platform is perhaps the most striking example of PaaS. <br><br>  <b>3. Cloudera - the average salary is 142,835 dollars a year.</b> <br>  Cloudera is the commercial version of Hadoop.  Hadoop is a free open source project for storing huge amounts of data on low-cost servers, but for all its freebies, this software is not so easy to use.  Therefore, several companies have created more pleasant versions of Hadoop, and Cloudera has become one of the most popular. <br><br>  <b>2. Cassandra - the average salary is 147,811 dollars a year.</b> <br>  Apache Cassandra is a free distributed database management system.  This is a noSQL system that allows you to store data of different types and volumes.  Apple is actively using Cassandra to store more than 10 petabytes of information. <br><br>  <b>1. HANA - the average salary is 154,749 dollars a year.</b> <br>  The high-performance NewSQL HANA platform developed by SAP, which is a competitor to Oracle.  HANA is the brainchild of another trend in data storage technology, known as in-memory computing technology. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298258/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298258/</a></p>
