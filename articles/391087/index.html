  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Children's version of the search engine - Kiddle</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I, like my mother, always well, somehow it was restless at heart to leave my laptop to children, because in search of some cartoon or something else, having entered the word into a search engine, of course, the content could be issued well, not quite for a child's eye.  And now, quite recently, a new search engine Kiddle, which should protect the content that is viewed by children.  Google Safe Search is built into this “search engine”, the job of this search engine is to “filter” adult content. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/059/372/0e9/0593720e967e4ffa84194f8288368dc4.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.kiddle.co/"><s>google</s> leave</a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For general information - such a search engine was registered in 2014.  She is “externally” similar to the Google search engine, only the traditional white background is replaced by the background of the “cosmic” character and the character appears - a funny robot, search queries are displayed in this order - first sites that are written specifically for children (1-3 lines search, filtered by Kiddle editors), then adult safe sites for children with content understandable for the child (4-7 lines, filtered and sorted by Kiddle editors), then adult safe websites with information that may be difficult for a child to understand  I (filtered by Google safe search). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb7/0d5/fdf/fb70d5fdfe8f4893a51adfdf15e26d5a.png"><br><br>  As a moderator, Kiddle "considers" and parents, if suddenly the vigilant parental eye caught a word that the search engine filter missed on any site - <a href="http://kiddle.co/keywordblocking.php">Keyword Blocking Request</a> to help.  You can also send a request to block the site with non-child content <a href="http://kiddle.co/siteblocking.php">Site Blocking Request</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae9/d3a/abd/ae9d3aabd0d34521baa711f7b61aa65f.png"><br><br>  By the way, the Kiddle search engine provides search results with pictures and a specially enlarged font to make it easier for children to navigate information.  Parents are assured that the information received by the site is deleted in a day. <br><br>  But still, as it turns out, the children's version is not 100% safe.  That is the point.  The system blocks words such as “sex”, “homosexual”, “suicide”, “murder”, “lesbians”, “gays”, but!  at the same time, such "suicide", "FGM" available.  In the English version of the article, the authors still assured that the search engine does not produce results when entering the name of the famous actress “Pamela Anderson” ... apparently the written name of the same actress in Cyrillic does not destroy the vulnerable children's psyche, because I was given two results. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a32/8ef/fd6/a328effd62104c1794c7f5df3d8db7bf.png"><br><br>  It is known that in February a new YouTube mobile application appeared under the Android operating system, which also allows you to protect the content / information available to children.  The YouTube Kids app, this works regardless of the main YouTube service.  Parents can set a timer to view the same cartoons, programs, limit the time.  The application is designed for small users - large buttons, pictures in full screen.  The application has lists and channels (shows, training, music, discoveries). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d59/b6e/56f/d59b6e56f002463abdf7e59bc8128035.png"><br><br>  Parents can write to YouTube directly from the application, if they suddenly “suspect” something wrong with the content. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/391087/">https://habr.com/ru/post/391087/</a></p>
