  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Qualcomm won a lawsuit with Apple, but the war is not over</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the past few months, the legal war between Apple and Qualcomm has intensified, for example, the chip maker was able to <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/apple-stops-selling-older-iphone-models-at-its-german-stores-following-a-court-decision/">ban</a> some iPhone models <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/apple-stops-selling-older-iphone-models-at-its-german-stores-following-a-court-decision/">in Germany</a> .  It seems that Qualcomm won another battle against the Cupertino company, as the San Diego jury ruled in his favor in one of the many ongoing legal cases. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/we/nj/1m/wenj1mapwsstwqjmyf3jfwemvwy.jpeg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-qualcomm-patent-infringement-verdict/">According to CNET</a> , this particular litigation involved several technologies patented by Qualcomm, which Apple used on its iPhones without permission.  Patents describe minor features of smartphones, for example, a patent that allows a phone to quickly connect to the Internet after it is turned on, or a patent that relates to battery life. <br><br>  As you probably know, the biggest point of discrepancy between the two companies is the use of Qualcomm modems on the iPhone, and this is not entirely in its favor.  While Qualcomm won one lawsuit, a preliminary decision on another case states that the chip maker owes Apple $ 1 billion in chargebacks that he hasn‚Äôt yet given, according <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-apple-qualcomm/us-judge-rules-qualcomm-owes-apple-nearly-1-billion-rebate-payment-idUKKCN1QW015">to Reuters</a> . <br><br>  This was part of an agreement between the two companies, under which Qualcomm will refund Apple some of the cost of its proprietary technologies if the iPhone maker does not sue.  Qualcomm claims that repayments were discontinued because Apple filed false and misleading claims to the Korea Fair Trade Commission, but Apple claims that it acted in accordance with the law and simply answered the questions asked by regulators as part of the investigation. <br><br>  Even if Qualcomm loses the case, it will not pay Apple a large amount, since the iPhone manufacturer has already saved the same amount in the payments that it also owes to the semiconductor company.  However, if before making a final decision, Qualcomm will have another victory, it will be a much more significant loss for Apple. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/443936/">https://habr.com/ru/post/443936/</a></p>
