This is a <b>form of customer feedback with the company</b> , which is now used almost everything.  But do companies fully draw on the opportunities that this function, already familiar to all of us, opens up for them? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Let's try to answer. <br><br>  Companies are used to perceive mobile applications as a marketing or e-commerce channel.  It is also known that <b>applications can be a source of valuable customer feedback</b> .  However, many companies are not able to correctly use the data obtained from them and analyze consumer wishes in detail. <br><br>  Those companies that use the feedback option for mobile applications often simply ignore its results.  Such data leads a new study Apptentive and SurveyMonkey.  The survey was conducted in December 2015, and the responses from more than 1,200 SurveyMonkey users were used as an analysis. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a1b/270/7e6/a1b2707e6ca24c2c8b871a55b1226fdf.jpg"><br><br>  Apptentive says that about 1% of customers provide feedback on their own, while 93% of users are ready to provide feedback at the request of the company. <br><br>  The main conclusion of the study: <b>feedback is a key tool to increase customer loyalty, and ignoring it, on the contrary, is a direct way to its loss</b> .  People who leave feedback, expect to answer.  55% of respondents said that if their feedback was ignored, it is not a fact that they will continue to use the services of the company.  The majority of respondents (67%) never received answers to their feedback. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/23a/349/599/23a34959956d47a4ad42f46896560cb4.jpg"><br><br>  The main reason users leave feedback is that they want to be helpful.  According to the survey results, the two main motives for providing customers with feedback are the desire to help other customers and the desire to help companies improve their service and reach new business heights.  And almost all respondents (99%) said they were ready to provide companies with feedback if they listen to their wishes and take measures to implement them. <br><br>  The graph above shows what kind of reaction customers expect from their companies on their feedback.  Of course, it is not always realistic to realize all the wishes of clients.  But timely response to feedback will significantly increase their loyalty to the brand and help further business development. <br><br>  And how do you work with customer feedback?  We are waiting for your answers in the survey and comments. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD • Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299548/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299548/</a></p>
