  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The delusional report from iOS autofill was adopted at the conference.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A senseless academic publication on nuclear physics written only with the help of keyboard prompts. IOS was adopted at a scientific-practical conference. <br><br>  Christoph Bartneck, a senior lecturer at HITLab at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, received a letter inviting him to present his report at the International Conference on Atomic and Nuclear Physics in the United States in November. <br><br>  ‚ÄúSince I have almost no knowledge of nuclear physics, I turned to keyboard prompts on iOS to help me write an article.  I started the sentences with ‚ÄúAtomic‚Äù or ‚ÄúNuclear‚Äù, and then I randomly clicked on the autocomplete offer, ‚ÄùChristoph writes <a href="http://www.bartneck.de/2016/10/20/ios-just-got-a-paper-on-nuclear-physics-accepted-at-a-scientific-conference/">in his blog</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/37f/66f/ca4/37f66fca474d9a6300198fe4742eeba6.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  "The text really does not make any sense." <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe atom of the best universe will have the right to be the same as you, as we will have to be a great place for a great time to enjoy the day you are a wonderful person to your wonderful time to have fun and take a great time and enjoy the great day you will enjoy time for your parents and children. "  An example from an <a href="https://ru.scribd.com/document/328296018/Atomic-Energy-will-have-been-made-available-to-a-single-source-by-Iris-Pear-PhD">abstract sentence</a> . <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JZEm5aOYfSo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  He concludes: "Strength is not a great place for a good time." <br><br>  Bartneck titled the publication, again through auto-complete.  "Atomic energy will be available for one source."  He took the image from the first available graphic in an article on nuclear physics on Wikipedia. <br><br>  He presented the article under a false personality: Assistant Professor Iris Peer from the USA, whose experience in atomic and nuclear physics was set forth in his biography, using contradictory gender pronouns. <br><br>  The publication was accepted only three hours later, when Bartnek received a letter confirming his participation in an oral report at an international conference. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI know that iOS is pretty good software, but achievements have never been so close,‚Äù Bartnek commented on his blog. <br><br>  He did not have to pay money to accept this publication, but the letter was an invitation to register for the conference as an academic speaker at a cost of $ 1,099 (can also be paid in euros or pounds). <br><br>  ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt complete this step, as my university will surely object me to spend money in this way,‚Äù Bartnek told Guardian Australia.  "I got the impression that this is not a very good conference." <br><br>  The International Conference on Atomic and Nuclear Physics will be held on November 17-18 in Atlanta, Georgia, and is organized by the ‚ÄúWorldwide Open Access Publications and International Scientific Conferences and Events‚Äù established in 2007. <br><br>  Bartnek said that taking into account the quality of the publication review process and the steep registration fee, it is reasonably certain that such a conference was created for profit and has nothing to do with science. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt yet responded to their email, but I‚Äôm tempted to ask them about reviewer comments.  It can be funny. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398467/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398467/</a></p>
