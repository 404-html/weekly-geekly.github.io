  <section class="page js-page"><h1>RedSlurm turns into a chamber and one-time event</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  On RedSlerm (classic administration in the Southbridge style) instead of the planned 70 seats will be 20. Since the main task we see is to record and work out a training course for our own newbies, this is even better: a small audience asks more corrosive questions. </p><br><p>  In addition, we do not plan to repeat the RedSlerm.  It will be held for the first and last time. </p><br><p>  <strong>The cat from the first Slurm to attract attention</strong> </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/q4/vz/8k/q4vz8k3iimqqkzt-zqrlr1fjq9g.jpeg"></p><br><p>  And now - how we came to such a life. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="ideya-redslyorma">  Idea RedSlerma </h2><br><p>  Southbridge 10 years old stuffed bumps in classical administration.  As the safety technique is written in blood, so are the regulations written by admins' tears. </p><br><p>  Let's say there is a problem of the human factor.  ‚ÄúThe team sets up the client‚Äôs servers according to the checklist, and still misses something.  Let's enter the point that after setting up the project must be transferred to the test of another team. "  A trifle, and errors in the initial configuration disappeared. </p><br><p>  As a result, Southbridge has a production culture that allows you to administer a lot of servers and sleep at night.  Why not talk about it? </p><br><p>  Personally, I would pay (and regularly pay) to see how my colleagues work.  Especially live: in a smoking-room they always tell such that no one will speak under the recording.  Therefore, it seemed to me that there would be a queue at RedSlerm: experienced administrators and IT-managers would come to look at something interesting, and beginners to get acquainted with industrial exploitation, to taste automation (for example, a script to automatically create a web site, database and FTP) take with you the finished technology work. </p><br><h2 id="bezuderzhnyy-optimizm">  Uncontrollable optimism </h2><br><p>  After the first Slerm, we thought, since in <a href="https://habr.com/company/southbridge/blog/419569/">such conditions</a> we had a decent intensity, we can do everything. </p><br><p>  Especially in a decent hotel. </p><br><p>  Especially with some kind of reputation: after all, the second event, not the first. </p><br><p>  And we cheerfully cut 70 places + online. </p><br><h2 id="surovaya-realnost">  Harsh reality </h2><br><p>  Either I was bad at talking about RedSlerom, or the idea itself is not very interesting to the masses, but there are few registrations for it, and mostly online. </p><br><p>  We lowered the price, and still the account registration went on units. </p><br><p>  When it came time to sign a contract with the hotel, we estimated the trend and reduced the number of places to 20. </p><br><h2 id="pochemu-etot-redslyorm-budet-edinstvennym">  Why this Redslerm will be the only one. </h2><br><p>  Preparing for the intensive, the speakers went over all the scripts and practices of Southbridge, systematized and improved something. </p><br><p>  Materials will be a training manual for the preparation of newcomers. </p><br><p>  All this is valuable, but one-time bonuses, so we decided: it makes no sense to repeat it.  Let RedSlerm be exclusive.  The only time Southbridge has opened its kitchen. </p><br><p>  If anyone is interested, the last places are sold <a href="https://slurm.io/redslurm/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr3">here</a> . </p></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/424695/">https://habr.com/ru/post/424695/</a></p>
