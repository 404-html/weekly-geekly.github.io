  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Read or buy?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello! <br><br>  In this article, we will focus on books, but rather on professional literature. <br><br>  I read a lot since childhood.  After graduating from college and starting to build a career, I realized that continuous development is the key to success.  And books are the most accessible development tool. <br><br>  From this point on, my home library began to grow with professional literature.  However, here I encountered some problems. <br><br>  First, I could not buy all the books I wanted.  I just did not have enough money. <br>  Secondly, purchased books often turned out to be absolutely useless, despite the excellent reviews. <br>  Finally, some books lost their relevance and I would like to put them somewhere, but not throw them out ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/24a/d30/e97/24ad30e97fe54572bcbd41eff73ceb1a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The idea was in the air, I caught it and tried to launch a community for the exchange of professional literature.  The idea was that users added their own books, which they wanted to share and share with them. <br>  Unfortunately, this experiment failed because users did not willingly add their books, and for a long time on the site it was possible to take only my personal books. <br><br>  Failure fails, but the problem has not gone away.  Fiction is a little easier - there is a really good selection of books in the libraries of large cities.  You can not say about the professional literature, the more highly specialized or in English. <br>  Such books are quite expensive and quickly lose their relevance. <br><br>  I found a like-minded person and now we are trying to solve these problems again, but with a different approach. <br>  We create a rental service for professional literature.  I will not give any links, since the purpose of this post is not to attract users.  I will tell you in detail about our project in the ‚ÄúI am promoting‚Äù hub as soon as we launch the prototype (this will happen at the end of February). <br><br>  Today I would like to ask for help from the community.  I am sure that GikTimes has a reading audience, and I want to ask some questions that will help us in our work on the project. <br><br>  Thanks in advance for your help. <br><br>  <b>In all matters we are talking about professional literature.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/376109/">https://habr.com/ru/post/376109/</a></p>
