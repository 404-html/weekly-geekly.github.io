The year 2018 has passed and the time has come to sum up.  This year was rich in innovations, which we described in detail in our <a href="https://habr.com/company/toster/">blog</a> . <br><br>  Over the past year, users of the Toaster asked almost 100 thousand questions, gave 166 thousand answers and found more than 45 thousand solutions.  In numbers, it looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9b/64/ui/9b64uillwgqss_xhuq86q1gbcza.png"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Last year we <a href="https://habr.com/company/toster/blog/347028/">set the format for</a> summing up and will stick to it.  Here are the top 20 tags of 2018 by the number of questions asked: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bv/hw/l8/bvhwl8ksfonxqkvjmv8bna5nz9c.png"><br>  The most popular again was Javascript, which was asked 12% of all questions.  Web development has once again entered the top interests of users of the Toaster. <br><br>  But the distribution of questions and answers on these tags.  Please note that a single question can have multiple tags at the same time. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m6/ig/w6/m6igw6uar9c3ipeiz2iiuws1u3u.png"><br>  In 2018, for each question, on average, we had 1.7 answers, and found solutions for 46% of the questions. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d8/kv/mz/d8kvmzdbujzhmjcjmi7uew44r4s.png"><br>  The most popular question, to which 100 people subscribed this year, was asked by Pavel Kalinin: <a href="https://toster.ru/q/527367">‚ÄúLayout from scratch: what are the main stages of work?‚Äù</a> <br><br>  And the most popular <a href="https://toster.ru/answer%3Fanswer_id%3D1213106">answer</a> to this question was given by Vladimir Proskurin and received for him 99 marks "Like". <br><br>  The most questions (227) were asked by the user <a href="https://toster.ru/user/BonBonSlick">BonBonSlick</a> .  Last year he was also the most active, although there were a lot more questions - 454. <br><br>  Most replies (2 345) were left by user <a href="https://toster.ru/user/dimonchik2013">dimonchik2013</a> .  And last year he was the most fruitful, he gave the most answers - 2347. Almost filigree accuracy! <br><br>  And the most solutions (1 193) were given by user <a href="https://toster.ru/user/0xD34F">0xD34F</a> .  A year earlier, <a href="https://toster.ru/user/Stalker_RED">Stalker_RED</a> took the first place in decisions and helped them 741 times with their answers. <br><br>  Congratulations on great results! <br><br>  Happy New Year!  We wish you success in the new year from the whole Toaster team.  And we, in turn, will continue to develop our service so that you can find answers to questions and help others find them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/434580/">https://habr.com/ru/post/434580/</a></p>
