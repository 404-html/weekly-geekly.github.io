  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How should a resume differ from your LinkedIn profile?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Your resume and LinkedIn page should not be copies of each other - they should complement each other and tell about you in such a way that you want to immediately take you to the team! <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bee/d08/659/beed086596374cc3bf48d9b23b45feb8.jpg"><br><br>  <b>1. It must be something more.</b> <br><h6>  Details, context, vivid pictures. <br>  Your LinkedIn profile is a tool for telling about bright spots in your biography (and professional as well).  There is no limit to one page, so you can safely tell about everything that does not fit in your resume. <br>  For example, look at the information about your professional experience.  Here you can explain how from the IT sphere you suddenly turned into PR.  Or vice versa.  Any unexpected twists in your resume will surely raise questions for the recruiter, so LinkedIn will help you answer them. <br>  In addition, here you can add your own wishes regarding what you want to see at your future place of work.  For example, having noticed that work with educational projects is very interesting to you and you are ready to develop in this direction. <br>  And we came up with an example for you: <br><br>  <i>Summary:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>“Increased sales by 25% due to the introduction of customer feedback and expanding the base”</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>LinkedIn:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>“In company N, I held the position of sales manager.</i>  <i>I was faced with the task of increasing the number of sales by at least 10%.</i>  <i>With the help of the introduction ... and ... I was able to achieve results and made a report on the tools used to increase the number of sales at a conference / meeting /.</i>  <i>Here is the presentation. "</i> </h6><br><br>  <b>We have an <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/7-tipov-programmistov/">article about the typology of programmers :)</a></b> <b><br></b> <br><br>  <b>2. No strict style.</b> <br><h6>  Resume should be updated every time you respond to a job.  Customize on style and aesthetics, add important details and so on.  It is not necessary to do this with LinkedIn - make it so that you yourself would like to go there.  Let it be an honest story about yourself as a professional.  No stationery, nothing very clamped and driven into the framework of business style and communication.  Try to just make it a little more human.  Then the recruiter will find it easier to approach you, and you will look more open. </h6><br><br>  <b>3. There must be evidence</b> <br><h6>  The summary is a statement of fact.  Like, he worked, he studied, I love to cook. <br>  Your social network profile is another matter.  If on linkedIn you indicate that you have had experience in preparing reports, writing articles for a blog, or maybe you are interested in photography, immediately attach a link to a resource where you can watch / read all this.  This also applies to recommendations.  That is, use it as an opportunity to collect all the evidence base about yourself so that no one dares to doubt that you are cool! <br>  And in general, already called gruzdem - climb into the body. </h6><br><br>  <b>4. No formalities.</b> <br><h6>  If you are familiar with yourself at all, then you can tell a good idea about yourself?  I don’t need this style “the robot came in, told me about it”. <br>  Make your profile such that the recruiter or new partner / colleague tells about himself / herself about his experience and what he would like to do.  Speak not about what you do, but about what you like to do, because then the likelihood that you will find work for your soul increases many times over. <br><br>  Here is an example (albeit an abstract one): <br>  “As an entrepreneur, I solved many problems and generally communicated with people a lot.  So the ability to find a way out of a variety of situations and the solution of a variety of cases - not just my skill, but what I love and what I enjoy.  10 years of professional experience did not affect my desire to create, change, or simply work in the field of marketing. ” </h6><br><br><h6>  Of course, your resume and LinkedIn page are versions of a story about your professional activities.  At least, they were created exactly for this, but after all, nothing prevents you from making two versions of the same story?  The plot just leave the same :) </h6></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300254/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300254/</a></p>
