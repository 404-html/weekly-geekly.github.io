  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Presumption of stupidity</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Old place of work.  All fees behind.  Last working day.  It remains to pass the laptop, having previously cleaned the data on it.  You close the lid.  Everything, you are ready for the last step: to get drunk with your now former colleagues and, possibly, friends.  A close colleague approaches you confusedly and asks: "so where are you now?".  And you explain to him where.  Along the way, help you uncork champagne or beer.  And now you are pouring yourself a glass and you realize that tomorrow you will not work here.  You're sad, but you have to move on, because this is your choice ... </p><br><p>  You know that you left a bunch of unclosed tasks.  They can not all be closed: all the time new ones are added.  You always had deadlines.  You would be happy to do everything correctly and well, so that you are not ashamed of your code.  So that you can be proud and speak - this is what I wrote.  But deadlines and promises ... They all messed up.  We had to cut corners and hammer crutches literally with a sledgehammer to make it work at least somehow.  But now it is in the past.  Let other people rake it, I wash my hands.  Forward to the new code, to the new team.  Oh, there will be everything for Feng Shui and how it should be. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  New place of work.  You give a brand new laptop, which you only dreamed of.  Show a new workplace and get acquainted with the team.  All very friendly and nice people.  Not a collective, but a fairy tale.  Sit in a comfortable chair.  The first task.  You're in anticipation.  You open the lid of the laptop, read it.  Nothing is clear.  New language, new product, all new.  It is necessary to adjust the environment at least a day, or even more.  The difficulty rolls over.  But you cope and solve problems one by one.  Everything works like a clock, the tools are comfortable and powerful.  You rejoice that you work in a team of professionals and use the most fashionable and reliable tools.  The only question you ask yourself is: WTF?  Why is it different in other places? </p><br><p>  Familiar is?  And I also do not. </p><br><p>  There are no perfect places where everything would suit you.  Where would be the perfect team.  Where would be convenient and stable tools.  Where there would be no deadlines.  What we have is always the result of a compromise between the skill of the team, competent leadership, the financial component, the technical part and the environment.  It is always a compromise.  Who deserved the team and the project.  We can do it better or worse.  If you are a skilled programmer, then your task is to make the project better and solve the accumulated and future problems.  If a beginner - to add features and somehow work.  The better you look, the better and better work. </p><br><p>  The world is not perfect.  And even in perfect tools there are perfect mistakes.  Errors of another level.  But mistakes.  The more complex the product, the more problems.  You can reduce the density of errors, but you can never reduce them to zero. </p><br><p>  Imperfection haunts us.  It is a part of the surrounding world.  You can hang out as a well-known substance, point the finger and talk - it's shit.  But this shit does not cease to be so.  We can transform it into something else.  And we can increase.  We are, yes. </p><br><p>  All mistakes are made due to the absence of something.  Lack of time, effort, knowledge, in the end.  It seems to you that you are smart and did a cool thing.  But there will be more intelligent people and they will show you what could have been done even better.  That you are not perfect.  It's time to admit the obvious.  And go on.  And try to make the environment around a little better, and then another. </p><br><p>  And all the arguments about the mind and intelligence are worth nothing.  What with the fact that someone asshole and wrote mudatskiy code?  You can point at it with your finger and swear.  The world will not notice this.  Only we ourselves change what is around.  We are changing this world. </p><br><p>  So what's the difference where to start? </p></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/427915/">https://habr.com/ru/post/427915/</a></p>
