Tips may be interesting primarily because, despite the great activity shown by this person, he still has not been caught. <br><br>  During the notorious FBI raid on <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/241270/">Operation Onymous darknet</a> sites, several sites with <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/241270/">restricted content</a> were closed.  The main goal was online shopping, selling drugs and weapons.  But among others, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/09/nachash-doxbin-dox-online">Doxbin</a> , which sold various personal information - documents, social security card numbers and other data, came under the distribution.  Nachash site administrator is still not caught. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúSince the raid did not capture me, I consider myself to be among the few who are sufficiently qualified to train others in security and working with hidden services,‚Äù writes Nachash.  ‚ÄúJust because I have more experience with hidden services than anyone else.‚Äù <br><br>  The main thing is not to mix your two different ‚Äúpersonalities‚Äù, that is, work on a darknet site with real life.  No need to work from the basement of the parent home or from other places where you usually visit.  Do not talk on the topics of one person, practicing another.  And take steps to ensure that you can not be traced by the style of writing. <br><br>  Separation of individuals, or compartmentalization, is a basic principle that is often violated.  The creator of Silk Road, Ross Ulbricht, advertised his site by signing an email containing the real name.  And the author Silk Road 2 registered with the hosting provider with his email. <br><br>  Further, Nacash advises not to keep any work logs and not to keep correspondence with anyone.  Ulbricht kept his correspondence with his colleagues and even kept a diary of his illegal work. <br><br>  During conversations, it is necessary to add false details, so that according to your stories about yourself it was impossible to make an accurate profile.  If you give out incorrect information about yourself, it will make the search for your person more difficult.  This was where Sabu, a member of the LulzSec group, slept - in a conversation with a man who turned out to be an FBI informant, he gave real details of his life, which helped the agency in its search. <br><br>  One of the classic mistakes - start chic after you managed to earn money on illegal sites.  Life beyond its means can attract the attention of the competent authorities. <br><br>  In the words of the author of the article, you do not need to rely only on Tor.  One technology alone, no matter how good it is, will not help you remain anonymous.  If you go through other places, they will catch you - no matter how secure your encryption is. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/356718/">https://habr.com/ru/post/356718/</a></p>
