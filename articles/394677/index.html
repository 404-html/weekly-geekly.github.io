Previously, the update went right after <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/276318/">the corresponding window was closed</a> , the company also put the update in <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/275828/">the Windows Task Scheduler list</a> , plus for Windows 7 users with the deactivated package KB3035583, it was <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/275572/">quietly activated again</a> .  Now users are <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/06/01/windows_10_nagware_no_way_out/">reporting a new</a> ‚Äúoffer that cannot be refused‚Äù: the Windows 10 update cannot be canceled because ... there is no Cancel button on the update window.  The only options for the user are to change the upgrade time or start it immediately.  Pressing the X button in the upper right corner does not change anything simply because there is no such button. <br><br>  Since the update cannot be canceled, the only thing that a user can do when this window appears is to update.  <b>At the same time, the company rejects all the allegations</b> , saying that it is impossible to get such a window without choosing ‚Äúupgrade to Windows 10‚Äù on your own and accepting an EULA.  Such a window, as in the preview screenshot, can appear only after performing all these actions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúThe message is inaccurate.  Upgrading to Windows 10 is a choice that helps people take advantage of the most secure and productive version of Windows at the moment.  People receive various notifications to receive updates, and can change the update time or refuse it if they wish, ‚Äù <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-makes-blocking-windows-10-recommended-update-near-impossible-report/">said</a> a company spokesman. <br><br>  Perhaps the company is really nothing to do with it, but the user's message is just a fake. <br><br>  Nevertheless, the company still tries to convince the average user to upgrade to the new version of their operating system using all available (legal) methods.  And if a more or less advanced user can opt out of this offer, then the user is ‚Äúnovice‚Äù level, and most of them are likely to get confused in all these windows, service packs and schedulers. <br><br>  At the same time, as it turned out, on Samsung laptops Windows 10 does not work too well.  So "not too good" that Samsung has <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/05/31/windows_10_samsung_fail/">officially announced</a> that it does not recommend upgrading to the new OS version for users of its laptops.  The reason for this is clear - the company did not develop a set of drivers specifically for Windows 10. But why the South Korean corporation did not do this is unclear.  Neither Samsung nor Microsoft have yet commented on this situation. <br><br>  As for Windows upgrade notifications, I remind you that they should disappear on July 29, as Microsoft completes the free update cycle.  Although, who knows, maybe on July 29, Microsoft will announce the renewal of the free update. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394677/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394677/</a></p>
