  <section class="page js-page"><h1>HTC Vive - Pre-order opening date and cost have become known</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So, finally, important details became known regarding another flagship VR device on the virtual reality market, the volume of which will grow to $ 80 billion by 2025, <br><br>  HTC and Valve presented the opening date of the pre-orders of the HTC Vive PRE virtual reality system, and also announced the recommended cost and terms of receipt to customers. <br><br>  A complete set consisting of a head unit, two wireless controllers and a motion tracking system can be pre-ordered starting February 29, at a price of $ 799.  First deliveries are expected in early April. <br>  For the most impatient on the site of the product set <a href="http://www.htcvive.com/us/">the time counter with a countdown</a> . <br><br>  The headset has a built-in microphone and Bluetooth-compatible with smartphones, so that the user can answer calls, read and write messages, check the calendar and schedule without removing the helmet.  For a limited time, Job Simulator and Fantastic Contraption games will be offered. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b87/c79/647/b87c796474e24324a6542b44d30b9794.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  This year, three virtual reality systems should come to the market at once, opening to the consumer sector impressions of immersion in another reality: Oculus Rift, HTC Vive PRE and PlayStation VR. <br><br>  These events should be the beginning of the era of virtual reality, serving as the starting point for the popularization of technology, content creation and new VR-systems. <br>  However, it is important to understand that the popularization of the phenomenon is impossible without the mass distribution, and the cost of consumer versions and the provision of content greatly affect the wide demand for such devices. <br>  After all, even among enthusiasts, few will agree to dump $ 600-800 for a toy for a couple of evenings, and in the case of Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, it is assumed that you own a computer based on Intel i5-4590 or higher, and also with NVIDIA GTX 970 or AMD 290 and 8GB RAM. <br><br>  At the beginning of the year, the recommended cost of Facebook's Oculus Rift from Facebook, which can be purchased for $ 599 or as part of a set with a computer for $ 1,499, became known. <br>  For $ 599, users get the headset, motion tracking system, remote control and gamepad from Xbox One. <br><br>  HTC Vive PRE has more extensive functionality and equipment: thanks to the Lighthouse tracking system, user movements are tracked in an area with sides of 3x4 meters, which contributes to the immersion effect. <br>  Also Vive PRE is equipped with a camera and will be accompanied by special software that allows you to scan the real space and use it in virtuality. <br>  In addition, the system comes with two wireless controllers that will become your hands in the virtual world. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-mxDQycSyDg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Well, despite the efforts and the desire of developers to make the technology more accessible, the acquisition of the first flagship devices is still quite expensive for ordinary customers today. <br>  In the summer, and maybe earlier, we will be able to find out the cost of another VR system, the PlayStation VR, which is expected to be available in the fall. <br>  Hopefully, Sony will offer a more affordable option, because as a rule, the company prefers to earn mainly on content. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390887/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390887/</a></p>
