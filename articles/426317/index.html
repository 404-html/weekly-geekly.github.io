  <section class="page js-page"><h1>1155 vs 2011. Only old people go to battle</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In 2017, AMD once again opened the Pandora’s box, launching mainstream processors with more than four cores, with a performance per core at least comparable to modern Intel processors with equal frequencies.  Full parity did not work out, but there is no longer one and a half to two times gap depending on the type of load, as in the days of FX.  In synthetics, the performance of Ryzen cores is roughly equal to the performance of Ivy Bridge cores (3xxx).  The move turned out to be pretty strong, so the blue team had to hastily release the six cores on the updated 1151. What am I doing for?  And actually to the fact that since last year, six or more nuclear processors with fast cores moved to the consumer segment from a narrow HEDT niche.  Among other things, this means that mass software has finally begun to be optimized for multi-core multi-threaded CPUs. <br><br>  What is a modern mass 6-8-core processor?  This is a frequency of 3.5-4.5GHz, a relatively fast inter-core bus of one architecture or another, dual-channel DDR4 memory with a frequency of 2.4+ GHz.  At the same time, the cores of the same Ryzen do not beat performance records to the beat.  But what if ... instead of a modern and rather expensive platform, take the old 2011 Intel platform, the benefit now is the supply of decommissioned server processors of the E5 v1 and v2 lines for this socket clearly exceeds demand?  Especially enterprising Chinese, having seen such a situation, quickly mastered the mass production of motherboards for this platform, and the remaining components, a processor with memory, are relatively inexpensive in the secondary market and are not particularly susceptible to aging.  The capacity of the register DDR3 memory will be lower by one channel than the DDR4, but then there are four memory channels on this platform. <br><br>  I do not have the Ryzen platform at hand, so we will compare the available configs, all related to the generation of Ivy Bridge.  In general, the platforms that are not comparable at the time (at least for the price) are compared, but the time equalizes everyone. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Test participants </h2><br>  The following configurations took part in the test: <br><br>  <b>MB</b> : ASUS P8Z77-V LX <br>  <b>RAM</b> : 2 x DDR3 Kingston Hyper-X 8GB 1600 @ 2150MHz <br>  <b>CPU</b> : <a href="https://ark.intel.com/ru/products/65523/Intel-Core-i7-3770K-Processor-8M-Cache-up-to-3-90-GHz-">Intel Core i7-3770K</a> @ 4440MHz <br>  4 cores, 8 threads, 8MB cache 3 levels, nominal frequency from 3.5GHz to 3.9GHz in boost.

Only 329 frames.  Import time, preview building and other operations were not measured, as it is not entirely clear how to measure them with sufficient accuracy.  The conversion time of this batch of files to JPEG was measured.  The task processing time was estimated by the difference in time of the change in the first and last exported JPEG.  Not the most accurate indicator, I agree, 3-5 seconds are not taken into account at the start of the export process, but an easily automated test and you do not need to constantly sit and monitor the process with a stopwatch, as you would when trying to estimate the import time, and all the systems in equal conditions.  The processing did not exactly rest on the disk, the source code and the export folder were on the SSD. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pn/ts/g7/pntsg7ifa-v4fxj5npuyndvujtg.png"><br><h4>  Adobe Lightroom 5.7 </h4><br>  The results were rather strange at first glance.  It would seem that the process of developing RAW images should be well parallelized.  And even if the development of a specific frame cannot be scattered across several cores, there were more than three hundred pictures in the processing queue!  Know yourself scatter each frame to your core.  But judging by the processor load, which ranged from 40% on i7 to 20% on E5-2680v2, the old Lightroom does not know how to do this.  According to the CPU loading graph, it can be seen that it cannot be used more than 4 threads, hence the minimal increase.  It is surprising that it exists at all - the speed per stream on a 10-core should be noticeably lower than the overclocked i7.  In general, the 2013 sample application is sharpened for a maximum of two to four-threaded processors and is not able to benefit from modern (and not very) multi-threaded processors. <br><br><h4>  Adobe Lightroom Classic CC (7.5) </h4><br>  After the results of the tests Lightroom 5.7, which caused disappointment, I decided to check how things are on the current versions of software from Adobe. <br><br>  Testing was carried out again with real settings.  The hardware acceleration of UI rendering was activated (judging by monitoring, Lighroom Classic supports drawing using DX12) and using OpenCL for Adobe Camera RAW, because in the absence of compatibility problems, no one in their right mind would turn off these options, but I’m testing system performance in general in certain tasks. <br><br>  Adobe Lightroom Classic CC performed much better than the 2013 version of Lightroom.  Apart from the fact that on I7, the latest version showed much better speed, the extra pair of cores gave a reduction in the processing time of the pack by almost a minute (55 seconds, to be exact), that is, by about 26%.  The addition of another 4 cores gave an acceleration of 51 seconds or 30%.  Excellent in itself, and if you compare the results of the i7 and E5-2680v2, it is altogether impressive.  Decimal core does the job exactly 2 times faster than quad core.  Scaling is more than linear, given that the i7 operates at 4.44GHz, and E5-2680v2 in boost squeezes out of itself 3.2GHz under load on all cores. <br><br>  The difference in the behavior of different versions of the same application clearly demonstrates that you cannot just take and speed up the software just by giving it a bunch of cores.  Software must also be appropriate. <br><br>  Yes, the new Lightroom Classic CC is good, but the trial will end soon, and there is no desire to post 900 rubles per month for a subscription, I would rather pay the full amount once, but Adobe does not offer this option.  The last Lightroom that could be bought, not rented is its sixth version.  But again, there is no reason to hope for an upgrade of this version, just as for noticeable discounts when upgrading from 5.7 to 6.x.  Not interested. <br><br>  I wonder what can replace it?  Nikon Capture NX?  Maybe, but he steadily fell at me processing 2-3 frames from the queue, so it was not possible to conduct tests.  It seems that some of the latest updates of Windows 10 broke it, but in any case, even if there is a normal multithreading, it is pointless to expect OpenCL support to be delivered to it, and without it, we will doom to repeatedly play Lightroom Classic. <br><br>  Raw Therapee?  Not even funny.  Despite the rich functionality, to use this miracle of Open Source, which the hand of the UX-designer obviously did not touch, had to force myself.  Hang up when you click on a folder and do not respond for 15 seconds without any indication of the process?  The processing time, at times exceeding even Lightroom 5.7 (it was not possible to measure, minutes for 5 Raw Therapee chewed on about a third of a pack, and I was tired of waiting)?  This is the norm.  Probably.  For someone.  May be.  But I'd rather pay for an adequate interface and a normal speed.  What do we have out of paid analogues working under Windows?  Who else makes graphics software? <br><br><h4>  Corel AfterShot Pro 3 </h4><br>  Corel with its Corel AfterShot Pro 3. Moreover, with applications for winning the form “Corel AfterShot Pro 3 is up to 4x faster than Adobe Lightroom”.  Already interesting. <br><br>  Of course, with Corel's quadrupled speed, it’s bent, of course, but on I7-3770K Corel AfetrShot Pro 3 plays back from Adobe Lightroom CC about 84 seconds from 211 or 40%.  At E5-1650v2, any fourfold superiority over Lightroom also smells, moreover, the gap was reduced, but he played 36 seconds or 24% in 300+ images.  But on 20 streams, an unpleasant surprise was waiting for me - the processing time of a pack increased one and a half times compared to 12 streams.  WTF ?!  And if you disable <abbr title="Hyperthreading">HT</abbr> ?  On 10 threads, it works quite normally, ends half a minute faster than on a six-core.  And if you simply set a limit on the number of threads with your hands, and turn the HT on the processor back on?  And about the same works.  That is, AfterShot Pro on the number of threads more than 10 starts to level off wildly on level ground.  Well, also the result.  Another proof that in order for multi-core CPUs to show themselves, they need the appropriate software.  And Corel AfetrShot Pro 3 was clearly sharpened by 4-8 threads. <br><br><h3>  Games </h3><br>  The choice is mainly due not to the representativeness of the sample, but to the fact that it was at hand from those games in which there are built-in benchmarks that allow to get less stable and repeatable results.  But some kind of logic can be traced. <br><br><h4>  Testing method </h4><br>  The settings in all games are maximum with the exception of anti-aliasing settings.  <abbr title="Antialiasing - full-screen anti-aliasing">AA is</abbr> disabled so as not to rest against the fillrate limit.  The minimum averaged FPS was taken into account as the main indicator of the comfort of the game process on the tested hardware with the maximum settings.  The indicator of “very rare events”, 0.1% min <abbr title="Frames per second">fps</abbr> , is still more an indicator of random events, and if microfreezes do not go a continuous stream every few seconds, then it seems to me that the comfort of the game is not particularly affected.  Naturally, I checked the frame-time schedule, and if the game did have problems with microfreezes, they were fixed.  The results of measurements were taken from the built-in benchmark of the game, if the benchmark does not allow obtaining statistics explicitly, as in GTA V, the Riva Tuner Statics Server was used to fix performance parameters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vq/8f/ck/vq8fckz67jmihgnqgh-n6kppdwu.png"><br><br><h4>  GTA V </h4><br>  Relatively middle-aged multiplatform game, on Windows uses the graphical API DX11.  Since it came out on consoles, with support for multithreading, everything is pretty good, and the requirements for core performance are moderate, so the game supports consoles of the previous generation.  Since the test cannot produce statistics, Riva Tuner Statistics Server was used to collect the test results.  In order to complicate the task of the processor, the options for increasing the range of detail and shadow rendering were included. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">screenshots of game settings for test</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fu/yz/jl/fuyzjldj-jazbbicznlnde0nyws.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qe/wq/1e/qewq1egx8t5u6wtjachoudnklwc.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fz/g6/li/fzg6liryrmgnlftbavwavfjqiga.png"><br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">test results</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><pre><code>I7-3770K

<h4>Far Cry 5</h4><br>
Мультиплатформенная игра этого года, на PC опять же работает под DX11. Ориентирована на PC и приставки последнего поколения. Многопоточность имеется, но любит быстрые ядра и почему-то HyperThreading. По крайней мере при его деактивации на платформе E5-2680v2 фреймтайм в тесте при наличии упора в CPU становился очень дёрганным с непонятными просадками в произвольных местах, начинались фризы раз в 5-6 секунд в тестовом отрезке. Если снять упор с CPU, подняв разрешение рендеринга, игра при снижении среднего FPS демонстрировала заметно более комфортный игровой процесс за счёт отсутствия микрофризов и рывков. Показатели среднего и минимального FPS при этом не менялись. После выхода последнего патча с HD текстурами я перетестировал игру на двух конфигурация, и не обнаружил вообще никакой разницы в производительности. Да, потребление VRAM возрастает с 2.4 до 4.6 гигабайт, но для 11-гиговой 1080Ti нагрузку это не меняет.<br>

<h4>Deus Ex Mankind Divided</h4><br>
Единственная игра, формально поддерживающая DX12. Тестировалась именно в этом режиме, не смотря на абсолютную его бессмысленность. В теории DX12 должен снижать процессорозависимость. На практике ничего, кроме снижения FPS на 15-20 кадров в секунду он не приносит, ни на йоту не изменяя графику в игре. Несколько искусственный тест получился, но так вышло.<br>

Остальные игры пошли вне зачёта, тк повторяемость показательных игровых отрезков на них околонулевая, но общая тенденция имеется, хоть и выразить её в точных цифрах минимального FPS не получается.<br>

<b>Игры на id tech 6. Doom, Wolfenstein New Colossus</b><br>
<br>
Игровой движок от ID Software порадовал. ID Tech 6 при использовании API Vulcan обеспечивает утилизацию всех ядер CPU, до которых может дотянуться. На E5-2680v2 нагрузка равномерно распределялась на все 20 потоков, чего не мог обеспечить никакой другой движок в тестах. В Doom счётчик кадров упёрся во вшитый лимит в 200 кадров в секунду на максимальных настройках на всех CPU.<br>

Wolfenstein New Colossus демонстрирует с одной стороны похожее поведение — он способен с пользой использовать 20 потоков, с другой — в нём нет вшитого лимита на 200 кадров в секунду и более сложная графика, в результате чего результаты стали отличаться: FPS колеблется от 170 до 230 на обоих Xeon-ах. На I7 разброс показателей больше – от 150 до 270. Минимальный FPS в сценах с кучей геометрии ниже, но там, где он упирается в скорость на ядро – FPS улетает в небеса. В целом все процессоры обеспечили одинаково комфортную игру. Отличить на глаз 150 минимальных FPS от 170 сложновато.<br>
<br>
<b>Cities Skylines</b><br>
<br>
Классическая полуторопоточная игра с нулевой оптимизацией под современные реалии. Ей не нужно ничего кроме пары быстрых ядер, поэтому показатели этой игры на E5-2680v2 удручили. FPS дропается ниже 25, симуляция дёргается, всё плохо. На E5-1650v2@4100 всё более или менее, FPS в районе 30, на I7-3770K@4444 в районе 35-40 при максимальном приближении и крупном городе. I5-7600K со стабильными 50-60 FPS вне досягаемости.<br>
<br>
<b>Однопоточная дичь: DosBox + Carmageddon + nGlide</b><br>
<br>
Суровая однопоточная нагрузка, двойная эмуляция, всё как мы любим. Единственный тип нагрузки, который вызвал проблемы при попытке запуска на сбалансированной схеме электропитания на Xeon-ах. С одной стороны, нагрузка сугубо однопоточная, с другой стороны, как бы я не крутил настройки, загрузить ядро целиком, хоть с активированным HT, хоть без него, DosBox не в состоянии, в результате чего не включается boost и частота болтается в диапазона от 1.2 до 3.5 GHz, и всё жутко тупит и дёргается. В чём проблема, разобраться так и не удалось.<br>
<br>
Лучше всего это видно на видео:<br>
<br>
<div class="spoiler"><b class="spoiler_title">Тестовый отрезок классического Carmageddon</b><div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sXXLOgVoiUA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div><br>
Лечится включением производительного плана питания, но всё равно загрузка ядра никогда не превышает 70-80%, про загрузку видеокарты и говорить смешно — в таком режиме нет вообще никакой разницы в производительности на интеловской встройке и на GTX1080Ti, но FPS плавает и проседает.<br>
<br>
Минимальный FPS временами падает ниже 30 на всех системах, но на E5-2680v2 он временами проваливается ниже 20. I7 заметно превосходит E5-1650v2 в комфорте – ниже 25 частота кадров не проседает, нет микрофризов, средний FPS выше на 5-7 кадров в секунду. E5-1650v2 где-то посередине. I5-7600K@4500 опять же недостижим.<br>

<h2>Выводы</h2><br>
Выводы в принципе ожидаемые. Оба зиона показали себя довольно неплохо, но не без нюансов.<br>
<br>
<b>E5-2680v2</b> ожидаемо отлично себя показал в оптимизированных под многопоточные CPU приложениях и неплохо в относительно современных играх при условии их оптимизации под многоядерные CPU. Не смотря на то, что он всё же уступил более высокочастотным процессорам в играх, тем не игры последних двух-трёх лет на максималках всё ещё играбельны, а в рабочих приложениях конкурентов он просто разорвал. Ещё одним достоинством этого процессора является то, что он холодный. Ни в одном тесте его температура не превышала 50 градусов, при том, что вентилятор кулера работал на минимальных оборотах и даже и не думал раскручиваться.<br>
<br>
<b>E5-1650v2</b> в разгоне показал себя наиболее универсальным процессором. Незначительно уступая обычным десктопным моделям в играх, он достаточно серьёзно превосходит их при работе с видео и графикой. Но и потребляет он изрядно, и греется сам и греет цепи питания от души.<br>
<br>
<b>I7-3770K</b>. Не смотря на внушительный возраст, в разгоне этот процессор и по сей день заметно превосходит прошлогодние камни в стоке за эту же цену. Да и в разгоне в половине случаев тоже. В большинстве случаев он обеспечивает примерно такую же или большую игровую производительность, а работать на нём заметно комфортнее, чем на том же I5-7600K. Превосходство в цифрах не поражает, но отзывчивость системы под нагрузкой на старом I7 куда выше, чем на современном четырёхядернике (теперь ближайший аналог — это I3-8100).<br>
<br>
По ощущениям, наиболее универсальным вариантом под платформу LGA2011v2 должны быть восьмиядерные Xeon-ы E5-2667v2 и E5-2687Wv2 c достаточно высокой частотой ядер в бусте, так как Xeon E5-2680v2 в некоторых сценариях явно упирался в скорость на поток, но это ещё 4-8 тысяч рублей сверху к его цене, что делает целосообразность использования такой конфигурации весьма сомнительной. С другой стороны, тот же E5-2680v2 за сравнительно небольшие деньги позволяет собрать двадцатиядерную и сорокапоточную систему с большим объёмом оперативной памяти, но в этом случае нужно чётко понимать цели, для которых собирается такой монстр (например, как <a href="https://ilipin.livejournal.com/161378.html">здесь</a>).<br>
<br>
PS: и да… китайская материнка прожила ровно столько, чтобы успеть снять тесты. При очередной неудачной попытке разгона E5-1650v2 она зависла под OCCT и больше не загрузилась. В качестве основной системы она проработала недели 3, проблем с ней в качестве платформы для рабочей станции не было вообще. Китайцам предъявлять претензии в данном случае странно, всё же разгон – это не беспроигрышная лотерея, и железо временами страдает.</div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/426317/">https://habr.com/ru/post/426317/</a></p>
