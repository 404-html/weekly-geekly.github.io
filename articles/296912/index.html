  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Seven simple rules for effective management of contextual advertising budget</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For most small businesses, advertising is a major part of the cost of promotion.  But since almost everyone uses contextual advertising, prices for its placement are constantly increasing. <br><br>  Vladimir Fomenko, contextual advertising specialist for <a href="http://www.totalview.ru/">Total View</a> media agency, told RBC about seven rules for effective contextual advertising management and cost optimization. <br><br><h4>  Count the cost of attraction </h4><br>  It is recommended to place ads only on key phrases that current customers enter and avoid ineffective requests. <a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  Good advertising for small businesses pays off at 100%.  Do you like that?  See a summary of the costs of context and profit.  If you spent 100 thousand rubles and received 20 orders, the cost of attracting one person was 5 thousand rubles.  If each client brought less than this amount, for example, 4 thousand rubles, then you are working in a minus. </blockquote><br><h4>  Do not seek first place </h4><br>  If you are not working in ‚Äúhot‚Äù niches (for example: ‚Äúevacuators‚Äù or ‚Äúon-site tire fitting‚Äù), it is senseless to overpay for first places in issuing or for special placement. <br><br><h4>  Use indirect queries </h4><br>  The target audience introduces not only direct requests, but also indirect ones.  Large teddy bears can be sold on request "how to make peace with a girl," and unique gadgets through "what to give to her husband." <br><br><h4>  Cut off untargeted audience </h4><br>  Use the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdWords">Google AdWords</a> Display Network banners, choosing the gender, age, place of residence, and preferences for your target audience. <br><br>  Turn off impressions in mobile apps.  Advertising from mobile applications in most cases is not targeted: the user accidentally clicks on a banner, being, for example, in a free game. <br><br><h4>  Constantly test the landing pages of the site </h4><br><blockquote>  For example, the user went to the site on request: "Dry Cleaning at VDNH".  On the first screen of the landing page it is written: "Dry cleaning with free delivery throughout Moscow."  The user sees a convenient offer, he does not need to take things to dry cleaning, the courier will do it. <br><br>  Try to think over and prescribe on the site answers to possible customer questions: ‚ÄúHow much is it more expensive?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow long will it be cleaned?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow and with what equipment is the cleaning performed?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat documents and guarantees will I receive?‚Äù . </blockquote><br><h4>  Connect multiple sales channels </h4><br>  The more sales channels used, the lower the cost of attracting customers (search engines, social networks, media resources, video channels, etc.). <br><br>  Some buyers do not immediately place an order, but first they are looking at the goods and leaving.  However, later, when they get to the site from a banner or from social networks, they draw up a long-awaited purchase. <br><br><h4>  Learn from competitors </h4><br>  There are many services with which you can "peep" advertising requests and ads of competitors.  For example, in <a href="http://spywords.ru/">SpyWords, it is</a> enough to enter the address of the competitor's site or a key phrase, and the system will display all the data on the requests. <br><br><h4>  Personalize advertising </h4><br><blockquote>  If the user entered in the search for "mobile tire fitting in Krasnogorsk" and on your landing page I saw the heading "Mobile tire fitting.  Departure to Krasnogorsk in 30 minutes ", the probability of a call from this page is much higher than with the usual title" Mobile Tire ". <br><br>  Moreover, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AF%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581.%25D0%2594%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582">Yandex.Direct</a> , and especially Google AdWords, crawls the content of landing pages.  When the site uses different headers for requests, the cost per click can be reduced by 1.5 times. </blockquote><br><h4>  Inform customers </h4><br>  Search engines, such as Yandex, are more likely to increase the issue of company sites that leave their details and other contacts for communication: address, telephone, work schedule.  In addition, in this way you increase customer confidence in your resource. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296912/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296912/</a></p>
