Internet anonymity, anti-detection, anti-tracking for anti-you and anti-us</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good time reading, dear readers of Habr. <br><br>  Read recently a number of articles, including on Habré, on digital prints of browsers and shadowing users on the Internet.  For example, the article <a href="https://habr.com/company/oleg-bunin/blog/321294">Anonymous Browser Identification</a> and <a href="http://www.forbes.ru/tehnologii/362961-lovushka-v-internete-chto-cifrovye-sledy-mogut-rasskazat-o-vas">Internet Trap</a> magazine Forbes magazine, the “Technology” section - “Big Data”. <br><br>  Or maybe I don't want to be considered!  Only, I'm afraid, the irony is that this is also an imprint, and, moreover, apparently, the main reason for the appearance of prints.  IMHO, only one way.  With regard to FireFox, if all the foxes in unison, and each individually, begin to yelp, that they are ordinary standard foxes, and not a torus, not chrome and not makos. <br><br>  But, out of academic interest, in order to preserve the individuality of foxes and in response to the next intrigues of wild capitalism, I want to offer the following cunning plan to the court of esteemed Habrasoobschestva. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>I want to make a reservation right away - I am not a specialist in the field of network security or anonymity, I did not belong to anonymous groups, I was not found out to be anonymous, I swear I don’t see the darknet age.</i> <br><br><h4>  Target operating systems and browsers </h4><br>  Windows 10 x64 and Firefox 62.0.3. <br><br><h4>  NOT what it is about </h4><br>  The fact that Winda sends telemetry and everything related to the configuration of Winda itself, as well as questions about antiviruses and firewalls, does not fit the article.

You must install the add-on <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/first-party-isolation/">First Party Isolation</a> . <br><br>  A button will appear <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/js/ce/oq/jsceoqbmzybb5j7p-oeshdx4vy0.png">  .  Do not press it before moving to the test site.  Before you return here, it should be returned to its original state. <br><br>  True, the author here broke the same system.  When pressed, it is pale (on), but not pressed (off). <br><br>  2.2.  Go to the website <a href="http://www.html-kit.com/tools/cookietester/">Cookie Tester</a> . <br><br>  Set Cookie. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/us/27/cv/us27cv0whjxjxoavrdviqfwy2ic.png"><br><br>  “Press” the set button.  And click on the website on "Refresh" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/br/gr/yu/brgryu3dqgqypfgjggfq3gpmjwk.png"><br><br>  Here you can read <a href="http://www.spy-soft.net/fpi-first-party-isolation/">Improving privacy in Firefox</a> . <br><br>  A'lya sandbox.  When the button is pressed, the insulation is turned on, and when it is pressed, it is turned off (and by default it for some reason is indeed turned off). <br><br>  Two states "isolated" and "not isolated."  At the same time, “not isolated” - for all sites one, and “isolated” - for each site is individual and one site does not have access to another. <br><br>  The same is true for one site - if you now press the button here, Habr will not see the cookie.  But calculate the second entry.  Therefore, dismiss without severance pay. <br><br>  But, on the other hand, cookies will not be transmitted to different sites anymore, when the button is on, the sites will no longer see cookies, so it will be difficult for them to be watched.  Although Evercookies and other nanotechnologies do not work, I found out. <br><br>  Suggestion for use: <br>  Leave the button on.  As far as I read, there may be a case when there are problems with authorization (sometimes the site sends one to another, but its own, that is, “legally”).  Then it will be necessary to disable it on this site (if you log in, turn it on, you will be logged out).  But I have not yet met such sites. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">3.

And with HTML5 canvas, etc.  A fox cannot do anything (or rather, maybe, but in a highly sophisticated way and it would be better not to - see below).  By the way, CCleaner demolishes them cleaned, but along with the history, cookies and other useful things. <br><br>  <a href="https://samy.pl/evercookie/">Site with Evercookie</a> , You must first click the top button, then the bottom button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8f/io/kc/8fiokc0o0rlax0dbbxbibxcjkye.png"><br><br>  Grabbed off: <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d0/ir/3n/d0ir3ncot1dw7vnr32dgrpky2z8.png"><br><br>  On the panel FireFox need to click: <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/te/mk/mu/temkmuvavbrhc0ehlwc8arrg6-a.png">  .

It is only inconvenient that all links clicked inside the container opens in the same container. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">By the way, one more profit from this technology, although it is so obvious, but still.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  If everything is distributed among the containers in the mail (if FireFox is the default browser or the web form of the mail is open) and in the internet, it will be possible to check if you got there, where you wanted, if something important: <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oc/jv/27/ocjv27n43qr3szizzlorctgbe0k.png"><br></div></div><br>  There is another technology, on top of these <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/temporary-containers/">temporary-containers</a> , which is oriented on tabs, and not on domains (although you can add a dependency, you can isolate a domain in one container, you can even subdomains). <br><br>  And at closing can rub the whole story.  And now would remove Evercookie from the canvas — they are there, or without (I checked, sir).  But IMHO - still damp.  FierFox tabs jump, sometimes close, etc.  etc.  And it slows down. <br><br>  Evercookie, on the site, it's better to delete <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jq/pj/my/jqpjmyuetp-2ltrjnkazk5himow.png"><br><br>  until the next call. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">4. To clean the previously cut</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The previously mentioned add-on "Cookie-AutoDelete" did not justify itself. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Cause</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Cookies-AutoDelete turned out to be, albeit completely implicitly, but incompatible with the technology of the first part isolation level <br>  As everyone understands - isolation is achieved by isolation (this is not you), including  and cookies, in connection with which FireFox puts appropriate "marks" in the database of cookies.sqlite.  And Cookies-AutoDelete interrupts it with its “CookiesAutoDelete” label (checked with <a href="">SQLiteStudio</a> ) <br></div></div><br>  I can offer Cookiebro to replace Cookies-AutoDelete <br>  - It is compatible <br>  - Although in English, but easily configured <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Cookies editor available</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  There are security settings for the treasured favorite cookies. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-c/z2/d4/-cz2d4gc6oooictsroflzqictdu.png"><br>  <u>Selected</u> - implies proof about compatibility <br>  <u>Secure</u> - transmit only via https <br>  <u>Http Only</u> - transmit only via http.  This is not in the sense of https!  see above.  It is in the sense - not to give Java and other potentially dangerous junk access, but to transfer only in the old manner, in the http header <br>  <u>Host Only</u> - do not give access to subdomains to the delicacy (in the example, only yandex.ru would have access, but Yandex.Music, etc. - no) <br></div></div><br>  The disadvantage is that the favorite cookie is preserved, you need to add the site to the white list, and the cookies for the site can be over 9000. Probably it somehow costs too, but I was not looking. <br>  Another minus - wherever you are registered, you must add to the white list (at the beginning with Habr, you unlock the cookie every 5 minutes, because the cookie was deleted with this frequency until this whistle bored). <br><br>  Reliably cuts out the E-tag along with the updated from paragraph 5 (with the inclusion of the “Limit tab history” option added in paragraph 5) <br><br>  Suggestion for use: <br>  To adjust all the previous ones and this item and it seems, you can score on cookies and stuff, the whole structure should be deleted by itself.  And train each counter site is not necessary.  Plus, pump the CCleaner according to the instructions in the article about the “forseniki” and configure it to delete everything else and compress the base. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">5. To cut ETag and other under-leveled nanotechnologies</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Addon <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/chameleon-ext/%3Fsrc%3Dsearch">Chameleon</a> .  WebExtension from Random Agent Spoofe. <br><br>  <i>Text changed due to update of proposed addon</i> <br><br>  Would suggest the following settings: <br><br>  <b>Options tab</b> <br>  - <u>Set Enable script injection</u> - otherwise half of the functionality will not work. <br>  - <u><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Web/API/Window/name">Set</a> protect <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Web/API/Window/name">window.name</a></u> - BUT!  Enabled option breaks the “I'm not a robot” captcha, or do not turn it on or remember it and turn it off in such cases <br>  - <u>Enable <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Privacy/Tracking_Protection">tracking protection</a></u> - probably not necessary, better then put uBlock and hide it (see. Below).  Otherwise, the "edblokupertye" sites will start to snap. <br>  - <u>Disable WebSockets</u> - IMHO is not necessary, then half of the services does not work. <br>  - <u>Set Limit tab history</u> - Limits <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Web/API/History_API">access to history for</a> sites (presumably up to 2 visits) <br>  - <u>Spoof Client Rects</u> - you can not expose, the following addition is also able to <br>  - <u>Screen size spoofing</u> - I suggest to choose “Custom” and set the resolution manually (see below “average fox temperature”) <br>  - <u>Enable 1st party isolation</u> is the same as the one set in item 1.  button. <br>  - <u>Resist fingerprinting</u> , IMHO - not worth it (prints, see below).  FireFox, instead of pretending to be a rag, begins for some reason to pretend to be a Tor browser. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lz/gb/ns/lzgbnsgy4ubgoglplpiicjdkhna.png"><br><br>  And Tor, as you know, few places like + will stop working half of the other add-on functionality + the window at the start of the browser ceases to unfold in full screen, for someone koit, not otherwise. <br><br>  <b>Headers tab</b> <br>  - <u>Set the Disable Authorization</u> - The browser allows you to send hidden authentication data to third-party sites, the inclusion of this option stops this disgrace.  But it may be difficult to authorize on some sites. <br>  - <u>Enable DNT (Do Not Track)</u> - Enable message sending (do not track).  Sites, of course, or ignore or pretend not.  IMHO - set (according to various data - it is recommended, it is not, depending on the number of browsers that have been tested and a set of statistics on this parameter, because the choice is set or not - from the point of view of “not standing out”, but not functional) <br>  - <u>Set Spoof If-None-Match</u> - Write random number in ETags <br>  - <u>Spoof X-Forwarded-For</u> - If you set, for example, the IP of the Netherlands, it will add it to the HTTP header and the site will decide that this is the IP of the computer, based on what the poorly configured proxies add to the header.  Those.  it seems like the IP of the computer is an IP proxy, and the IP in the header is the other way around and the IP from the header is placed in the site log.  But here, in my opinion, it’s better not to, the provider over IP will be banned, like a left proxy.  Another question is that when using a proxy, it may be relevant so that if it is fig, the real IP does not pass in the header. <br>  - <u>Disable Referer</u> - IMHO not needed.  Turns off the referenes, you can not, for example, return when turning pages on the site to the previous page <br>  - <u>Set Spoof Source Referer</u> (encloses it when going to the site - referring to it) <br>  - <u>Set Upgrade Insecure Requests</u> - automatically request a website via https if it works in both modes (http and https) <br>  - <u>Referer X Origin Policy</u> - transfer the base domain to the referee.  “Match base domain” is recommended (but not sure that it will not break anything, if for some reason within the domain it is important which subdomain you have changed from).  Example: for example.com, news.example.com, blog.example.com - example.com will be referred to. <br>  - <u>Rferer Trimming Policy</u> - trim the transmitted referrer.  “Scheme, host, port, path” is recommended.  Example: for <a href="https://example.com/">example.com</a> link: 8080 / page? Privacy = false &amp; trackingid = XYZ, will be transmitted - <a href="https://example.com/">example.com</a> : 8080 / page <br>  - <u>Set Spoof Accept-Encoding</u> - will replace HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING with gzip, deflate.  It seems to be no problem <br>  - <u>Spoof Accept-Language</u> - language, “eu-US” is recommended, but sites may attempt to issue content in this language. <br><br>  I suggest choosing the average temperature for the fox as follows: switch user agents within the versions of the original OS and within the versions of FireFox (why - see the next article).  I think a couple of versions of the Fox <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/broWsers/browsers_firefox.asp">61 and 62</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/broWsers/browsers_os.asp">Windows 7 with Windows 10</a> will fit, the screen size is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/broWsers/browsers_display.asp">1366x768 or “any”</a> , more specifically, you can specify more here <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/">StatCounter</a> . <br><br>  It should be borne in mind that changing the user agent with the investment tool - any add-ons, such as “GoogleTranslate” are rented by the real user agent, since  packets past the chameleon slips. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Masking costs</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  - If you pretend to be a mobile phone - I think everyone knows the consequences <br>  - Pretending to be Google Chrome is fraught, Google will take over its (and even redirects will stop laying), but it will begin to quietly feed a disguised fox with something inedible for it with which it will start to lag, and on YouTube you know what happens to disappear besides the video that was opened <br>  - The customer-oriented M $ will persistently push the installation packages for the OS that is exhibited in the user agent, even if it is KolibriOS <br>  - Attempts to replace fonts are a sure way to stay without Google Doc <br>  - Attempts to cast an IP address through the headers permanently lead to an awkward situation: they do not allow Google, content from Yandex, with traditional Russian hospitality, they cut it out, and Dak Dac-Go and StartPage are not interesting, you can get there without such tricks <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">6.

Privatize the Fox and wean her alien homeland to love</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  IMHO, the main problem of fox privacy is in bugs, more precisely in their use, and in geolocation.  And it’s not even about <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/ru/kb/pokazyvaet-li-firefox-moyo-mestopolozhenie-veb-saj%3Fredirectlocale%3Den-US%26redirectslug%3Ddoes-firefox-share-my-location-web-sites">FireFox</a> and Google, but about <s>the geotagging</s> <a href="http://rmmedia.ru/threads/73641/">itself</a> .  Especially when using VPN - file, on IP you are Leo Tolstoy, and on MAC - Muscovite is simple.  The rest is really so, throwing with a pitchfork on the GCLI screenshots is somehow not constructive. <br><br>  The reason for the trouble with geolocation: <a href="https://hot-wifi.ru/radar/">this one here</a> and the like.  Therefore, I would suggest geolocation in FireFox not to disconnect, but use <a href="https://www.comss.ru/page.php%3Fid%3D1175">secure connections</a> , something to <a href="https://yandex.ru/search/%3Ftext%3D%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%2520mac%2520%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%26lr%3D213%26clid%3D2186620">mock with the MAC address</a> , all the more, it can already be built in, despite all the research of the British military <s>scientists</s> , since a) find protection from this circumvention ( it already exists too, but you need to google and study) and not to MAC's surprise - I think everything is clear b) not everyone uses every wunderwalf and other neural networks, but they connect to MAC.

Let's go to the boas! ”- as a result, under suspicion of the KGB and personally Comrade Stalin. <br><br>  By the way, the main reason for such browsers and epochal hedgehogs battle with snakes is not because of the nontrivial intrigues of enemy intelligence, but because <a href="https://ruseller.com/lessons.php%3Frub%3D1%26id%3D2020">of innovation curves like the</a> HTML5 <a href="https://ruseller.com/lessons.php%3Frub%3D1%26id%3D2020">ping attribute</a> , which is potentially able to pass the user to all advertisers and special services of the world, if they are entered there through space, and zapilivaniya anywhere <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Web/API/Navigator">navigator</a> functionality.

Separate file regarding the safe privatization of the fox - without fail, lay out <s>, go for a week</s> .  And at the moment you can: <br>  1. Go to the profile folder (there, instead of x - numbers \ letters), something like this: C: \ Users \ User \ AppData \ Roaming \ Mozilla \ Firefox \ Profiles \ xxxxx.defalut <br>  2. See if there is a user.js file <br>  3. If there is - you need to open it, if not - create it. <br>  4. From the code below - move the blocks there: <br><ul><li>  potential security holes; </li><li>  potential leakage; </li><li>  potential prints; </li><li>  perhaps - an extra load (I do not think that the functionality of sending statistics Mozill is relevant for you); </li></ul><br><br>  5. Save the file, restart the fox. <br><br>  6. This file - user.js can be saved and used after reinstalling FireFox. <br>  But there are two ambushes: <br>  <u>Number of times.</u>  It must be remembered that it takes precedence over the settings, that is, if there is a value = true for something, it will be impossible to prove to FireFox that it = false through about: config.  It will be necessary to edit the file. <br>  <u>Number two</u> .  Deleting a file will not lead to the expected deprivatization of the fox, but to predictable attempts to recall what has been changed there and to reflect on how to live with it now.  Therefore, in the file I wrote the “default settings”.  In order to “roll back” these changes, in which case, it will be necessary in this file to change the settings to those specified by default. <br>  <u>But the point is this</u> : at every launch, FireFox, having smelled this file, reads it and changes its tinctures.  They remain so changed, even if there is no file, but then malicious attempts to change these settings in the fox itself will not be rolled, it will again read them from the file when it is loaded. <br><br>  6. If the Internet comes up, you will need to open the file with a new one, find the record and change true to false: <br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">user_pref(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"network.dns.disableIPv6"</span></span>, &lt;b&gt;<span class="hljs-literal"><span class="hljs-literal">false</span></span>&lt;<span class="hljs-regexp"><span class="hljs-regexp">/b&gt;);</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  (which is, in fact, very unlikely, especially if you do not know what it is. this protocol is promising, but not common) <br><br>  7. In the same place, open the SiteSecurityServiceState file, delete the contents, close and save.  Set the attribute "read only".
