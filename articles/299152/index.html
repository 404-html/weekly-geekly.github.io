Remember customers!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3f8/3b0/1cd/3f83b01cdafc4072fb14afa04eb21465.png" align="left"><br><br>  All companies that have a website, indicate on it a contact e-mail.  ‚ÄúWhy are you doing this ?!‚Äù, I ask such companies in bewilderment.  After all, you still do not read anything there.  And your spam filters are the most powerful in the world! <br><br>  Advice to companies that are listed on the website e-mail.  Please think about what someone might write there.  Next is a small instructive story about an attempt to contact by e-mail. <br><br>  So, I needed a simple 1C setup service.  I went to the site of the company that provides this service.  And I saw their contact e-mail in addition to the phone number.  I did not call.  You can consider me a bore, but in some cases it is more convenient for me to write an e-mail than to call.  Why?  Well, because five times telling different people what I need to actually do to the first secretary, second secretary, etc.  - it's too much.  Having written an e-mail, I waited for an answer. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Of course he did not follow.  Notice of reading, too, did not come.  Then I wrote through the form on the site, I didn‚Äôt guess the captcha from the first time.  And at the end of the message I attributed that I had previously sent a letter to an e-mail, but they did not respond there. <br><br>  After some time, the message through the form on the site reacted and apologized for the fact that my email sent to their contact e-mail ... got into spam. <br><br>  One would like to turn to companies that are supposedly ready to receive emails from customers: ‚ÄúGuys!  What are you, what spam filters?  Turn them off completely.  They cut clients' letters for a sweet soul. ‚ÄùAnd if you have hundreds or thousands of letters a day on such an e-mail, then you should put an individual employee in the post‚Äú spam filter ‚Äùfor this. <br><br>  If it is expensive, inconvenient, etc., to assign a person to the ‚Äúspam filter‚Äù position, then it would be better not to indicate the e-mail on the site at all, but only the telephone.  After writing a letter that fell into the spam filter, I got only a negative impression. <br><br>  I summarize.  It is convenient for some customers to write by e-mail.  If your company offers this method of communication, then make it work.  Disable all spam filters.  Spam is a company problem, not a client. <br><br>  PS We have spam filters disabled altogether. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299152/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299152/</a></p>
