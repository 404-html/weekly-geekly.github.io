Through it, you can supposedly stitch through the fabric of space-time, moving quickly from one end of the universe to another.  At least this is how wormholes worked in science fiction films like Stargate or Star Trek, from which this term came. <br><br>  The mechanism of movement through the wormhole can be compared with the dynamics of needle movement, which directly sews two opposite ends of the folded tissue. <br><br>  The tempting idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmoving through space excites the minds of not only science fiction fans, but also scientists from the Department of Physics of the Autonomous University of Barcelona. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Spanish physicists <a href="http://www.uab.cat/web/newsroom/news-detail/magnetic-wormhole-created-for-first-time-1345668003610.html%3Fnoticiaid%3D1345689132054">have created something called a magnetic wormhole in the laboratory</a> .  This is a device that magnetically connects two regions of space-time.  That is, the magnetic field formed in one region is exactly recreated in another region. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/820/a4d/1b6/820a4d1b6e5c4c44ad55ce6dbd8a90b8.jpg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúWith the help of modern technologies, it is impossible to create a gravitational wormhole, because to control the field, you will need a huge amount of gravitational energy that no one yet knows how to generate,‚Äù the university website says.  ‚ÄúIn the field of electromagnetism, however, advances in the development of metamaterials and invisibility allowed researchers to design several designs that allow it.‚Äù <br><br>  Two regions are connected by a tunnel through which a magnetic field is transmitted, but this tunnel cannot be detected from the side.  That is, it is visible to the naked eye, but there is no magnetic field around it. <br><br>  Special metamaterials and meta-surfaces were used for this, so the source‚Äôs magnetic field ‚Äî a magnet or an electromagnet ‚Äî appears at the other end of the tunnel as an isolated magnetic monopole.  This result is surprising in itself, because magnetic monopoles, i.e. magnets with only one pole, north or south, do not exist in nature.  It seems that the magnetic field seems to be moving from one place to another through a dimension outside the usual three-dimensional space. <br><br>  Externally, a magnetic wormhole looks like a sphere made of several layers.  The outer layer has a ferromagnetic surface, the second inner layer is made of superconducting material, and inside the sphere there is a ferromagnetic sheet rolled into a cylinder shape connecting the opposite ends of the sphere. <br><br>  The magnetic wormhole ‚Äúchanges the topology of space because its internal volume is magnetically erased from space,‚Äù explains √Ålvar S√°nchez, lead author of the scientific work. <br><br>  Last year, the same group of researchers developed a magnetic fiber through which a magnetic field is transmitted from one region to another.  But its magnetic field could be detected, now it was isolated and reached full ‚Äúinvisibility‚Äù. <br><br>  Experts say that the magnetic wormhole can be used in medicine.  It becomes possible to carry out magnetic resonance scanning of patients in more comfortable conditions for them.  That is, the patient is treated in one place, and the magnetic field detector is located in another.  In addition, you can scan several parts of the patient's body at the same time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/366315/">https://habr.com/ru/post/366315/</a></p>
