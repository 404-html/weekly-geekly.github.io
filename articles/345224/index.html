In 2016, the latter managed to launch a successful Russian ICO project (actually, Waves), collect 30,000 bitcoins, start producing its own tokens and, finally, build its startup into the status of “full-scale crypto-Kickstarter”, allowing other companies and startups to collect serious funds through decentralized crowdfunding. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Among the successful cases of collecting "serious funds" on the basis of Waves is, for example, the "Australian loyalty program" ($ 1 million).  From Russian companies - the farm company “Ecosystem of Kolionovo” ($ 510.5 thousand), encrypted VoIP telephony operator EncryptoTel ($ 4.4 million), MobileGo mobile gaming platform focused on the use of cryptocurrency ($ 53 million), industrial start-up ZrCoin ($ 4 , 5 million).  On the Waves Platform, they launch, release their own tokens and attract external financing and IT projects.  Ivanov quite readily speaks of cases in his interviews and speeches. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/re/ky/x9/rekyx9kk2sfgqpwtf1neimfefuw.jpeg"><br><br>  The platform is developing vigorously: in the past year, Waves became a strategic partner of Gazprom "in the field of ICO promotion and blockchain solutions", entered the twenty of the most influential companies in the industry with a capitalization of more than $ 1 billion. Waves ecosystem includes a platform for launching crowdfunding campaigns, its own decentralized Exchange, which presents more than seventy cryptocurrencies, and mobile applications. <br><br>  Waves Platform does not charge a commission from companies, but it does profit from selling its own tokens and advising startups.  All development is conducted in Moscow.  We even talked about the future of the blockchain during the Blockchain Weekend in the Binary District on December 16 (yes, since the blockchain became one of the most discussed technologies of the year, there should be a lot of ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pt/ju/82/ptju82veyb6fj4da1bhp3a7prgw.jpeg"><br><br><blockquote>  <i>“I really hope that next year the blockchain will be massively integrated into marketplaces, retail platforms.</i>  <i>Perhaps even individual retail entrepreneurs will integrate crypto payment.</i>  <i>It all starts with e-commerce, with companies that sell software, for example.</i>  <i>Maybe gaming companies will start selling games for a crypt - that would be a good start.</i>  <i>I think there will be a lot of projects related to certification and concluding deals, which finally came out in a public, not a test release.</i>  <i>The blockchain can store detailed and unchanging information about company ratings, certification, up to the ownership of someone’s property.</i>  <i>And in Russia all this will develop faster, even despite the absence of regulation.</i>  <i>We have a very strong community.</i>  <i>Many technologies, the right ideas and cool solutions start in Russia, and there simply aren’t enough hands and man-hours to realize everything.</i>  <i>On the other hand, many experienced developers in other areas are afraid of the blockchain, as if something new, are afraid of rumors that this is a “bubble”.</i>  <i>Someone generally believes that cryptocurrency is only Bitcoin and ether, and in principle does not think about the technology on the basis of which they develop.</i>  <i>Even assuming that bitcoin and ethereum are just popular projects, the blockchain, as a technology, still gives tremendous opportunities and is developing far from only in the financial sphere. ”</i> <br>  <b>Philipp Philippak, developer of the Waves Platform</b> </blockquote><br>  In his speech on December 21, the founder of Waves will talk about how blockchain really changes business and government today, and how technology will evolve in 2018, plans for further software development, new partners for Waves (not Gazprom uniform) and global infrastructure projects. Waves, which will ensure the evolution of the platform into a multi-purpose open blockchain platform for various businesses. <br><br>  Participants of the mitap will discuss the use of the blockchain in the modern world and Waves products, including new ones.  The platform will present a new integrated interface for the ecosystem, the decentralized exchange (DEX) and the Waves wallet - "Client 1.0".  In the new versions by Waves, the wallet and the integrated decentralized exchange look and work just like traditional banking and commercial online applications.  The familiar interface and toolkit functions on the basis of a peering technology. <br><br>  Following Moscow, Waves and Binary District will hold several meetings in different European cities to talk about the plans and products of the platform. <br><br>  Connect to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DaWgSXnRb9kw">broadcast mitap</a> at 20:00 and judge for yourself what to expect from the blockchain in 2018. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/345224/">https://habr.com/ru/post/345224/</a></p>
