The theme of the meeting, as before, was the official‚Äôs proposal to establish the Internet Development Institute.  The main function of this organization is to ensure the interaction of power structures with the players of the Internet market. <br><br>  The meeting was attended by deputies of the State Duma, as well as various participants in the Internet industry, including representatives of the Internet Initiatives Development Fund, the Russian Association of Electronic Communications (RAEC), Mail.ru Group, Yandex, Megafon, 1C, RBC , Rambler, Softkey, Gazprom-Media, Ozon, Liveinternet, etc. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  According to the results of the meeting, it was determined that the future council of the institute will be headed by <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE,_%25D0%2593%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD_%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">German Klimenko</a> , director and owner of Liveinternet. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fcf/b4b/dd9/fcfb4bdd959148dbbf1b92887da78043.png" alt="german" align="right"><br>  This proposal was voiced at a closed discussion event last year, at the Russian Interactive Week (RIW) conference.  Then the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis education was discussed, as another attempt to find points of contact between the government, the Internet, telecom and the software industry.  The main task of Iran, most likely, will be to support the interests of Internet companies in legislative initiatives, as well as support for the e-commerce market, including from the pressure of Western companies that are actively holding the market niche that is not so developed in our country.  It also assumes close cooperation of the institute with the State Duma Committee on Information Policy. <br><br>  The meeting participants discussed the mutually beneficial conditions that such a body can provide.  The state will receive the opportunity to receive answers to its questions, in terms of, and businessmen will be able to voice and quickly solve existing and future industry problems. <br><br>  In the framework of the current meeting, it was still not possible to resolve the issue of financing this organization, but there were proposals on various ways for the institute to become self-sufficient, including various studies. <br><br>  It becomes clear that in connection with the recent events both contracting parties are extremely interested in each other, for closer interaction and support. <br><br>  The founders of the Islamic Republic of Iran announced - the Russian Association of Electronic Communications (RAEC), the future chairman of the board German Klimenko, the Internet Initiatives Development Foundation (IIDF), the Media Communication Union and the Regional Public Center for Internet Technologies. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286548/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286548/</a></p>
