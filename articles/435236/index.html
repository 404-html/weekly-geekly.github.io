The New Year holidays are coming to an end.  It's time to start remembering bytes, commands, variables, cycles ... <br><br>  Something I have already forgotten with these holidays.  We'll have to remember together! <br><br>  Today we will make an interpreter for our byte-machine.  This is the third article, the first parts here: <a href="https://habr.com/post/431932/">part 1</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/post/433836/">part 2</a> . <br><br>  All happy new year, and welcome under kat! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To begin, answer questions from <a href="https://habr.com/users/fpauk/" class="user_link">fpauk</a> .  These questions are completely correct.  Now the architecture of this byte-machine is such that we work with direct, processor addresses.  But these addresses are not in the byte-code, they are formed after the start of the system.  After starting the system, we can create any pointers, and this code will work correctly on any platform.  For example, the address of a variable or array can be obtained with the var0 command.  This command will work on any platform and return the correct address specific to that platform.  Then you can somehow work with this address. <br><br>  But still, <a href="https://habr.com/users/fpauk/" class="user_link">fpauk is</a> right.  Address in bytecode can not be saved.  It turns out that we can write platform-independent code, but for this we need to make some effort.  In particular, make sure that the bytecode does not get the address.  And they can get if, for example, the compiled code is saved to a file.  There will be data in it, and they can be addresses.  For example, the values ​​of the variables here, context, and others. <br><br>  To get rid of such a problem, you need to make the addresses virtual.  Addressing the x86 processor is quite powerful, and, in most cases, it will not even add extra commands.  But nevertheless I will continue in the current architecture, with absolute addresses.  And then, when we reach the tests, it will be possible to remake the addresses into virtual ones, and see how this affects the performance.  It is interesting. <br><br><h4>  Warm up </h4><br>  And now a little warm-up.  Let's make another batch of small but useful byte commands.  These will be the nip, emit, 1+, + !, -!, Count commands, work with return stack r&gt;,&gt; r, r @, string literal ("), and constant words 1, 2, 3, 4, 8. Do not forget to include them in the command table. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Here is the code for these commands.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><pre><code class="cpp hljs">b_nip = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x39</span></span> bcmd_nip: pop rax mov [rsp], rax jmp _next b_emit = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x81</span></span> bcmd_emit: pop rax mov rsi, offset emit_buf # адрес буфера mov [rsi], al mov rax, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> # системный вызов № <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> - sys_write mov rdi, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> # поток № <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> - <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">stdout</span></span> mov rdx, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> # длинна буфера push r8 syscall # вызов ядра pop r8 jmp _next b_wp = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x18</span></span> bcmd_wp: incq [rsp] jmp _next b_setp = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x48</span></span> bcmd_setp: pop rcx pop rax add [rcx], rax jmp _next b_setm = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x49</span></span> bcmd_setm: pop rcx pop rax sub [rcx], rax jmp _next b_2r = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x60</span></span> bcmd_2r: pop rax sub rbp, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">8</span></span> mov [rbp], rax jmp _next b_r2 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x61</span></span> bcmd_r2: push [rbp] add rbp, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">8</span></span> jmp _next b_rget = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x62</span></span> bcmd_rget: push [rbp] jmp _next b_str = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x82</span></span> bcmd_str: movzx rax, byte ptr [r8] lea r8, [r8 + rax + <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span>] jmp _next b_count = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x84</span></span> bcmd_count: pop rcx movzx rax, byte ptr [rcx] inc rcx push rcx push rax jmp _next b_num1 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x03</span></span> bcmd_num1: push <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> jmp _next b_num2 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x04</span></span> bcmd_num2: push <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">2</span></span> jmp _next b_num3 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x05</span></span> bcmd_num3: push <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">3</span></span> jmp _next b_num4 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x06</span></span> bcmd_num4: push <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">4</span></span> jmp _next b_num8 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x07</span></span> bcmd_num8: push <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">8</span></span> jmp _next</code> </pre> <br></div></div><br>  The nip command deletes the word under the top of the stack.  It is equivalent to the swap drop commands.  Sometimes it can be useful. <br><br>  The emit command prints one character from the stack.  It uses the same system call number 1, a character buffered with a length of 1. <br><br>  The count command is very simple - it takes from the stack the address of the line with the counter and turns it into two values ​​- the address of the line without a counter and the length. <br><br>  The b_2r, b_r2, b_rget commands are the Fort words r&gt;,&gt; r, r @.  The first one gets the word from the stack of returns and puts it on the arithmetic stack.  The second performs the opposite operation.  The third one - copies the word from the return stack, puts it into the arithmetic, the return stack does not change. <br><br>  The b_setp and b_setm commands are the words +!  and -! .. They take the value and address from the stack, and modify the word to the specified address, adding or removing the value from the stack. <br><br>  The b_str command has an arbitrary length parameter — a string with a counter.  This line is in the bytecode after the command byte, and the command simply pushes the address of that line onto the stack.  In fact, this is a string literal. <br><br>  The rest of the team, I think, does not need comments. <br><br>  We also make a command to print a constant string (. "). We implement it as an entry point to type, as follows: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">b_strp = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x83</span></span> bcmd_strp: movsx rax, byte ptr [r8] inc r8 push rax push r8 add r8, rax b_type = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x80</span></span> bcmd_type: mov rax, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> # системный вызов № <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> - sys_write mov rdi, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> # поток № <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> - <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">stdout</span></span> pop rdx # длинна буфера pop rsi # адрес буфера push r8 syscall # вызов ядра pop r8 jmp _next</code> </pre><br>  This command is similar in structure to b_str.  Only she puts nothing on the stack.  The string located behind this command as a parameter is simply output to the user. <br><br>  The warm-up is over, it's time for something more serious.  We will deal with the word-generators and the rest of the var commands. <br><br><h4>  Word Generators </h4><br>  Recall the variables.  How they are arranged at the byte-code level we know (var0 command).  To create a new variable, the following construction is used in the forte: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">variable &lt;имя переменной&gt;</code> </pre><br>  After performing such a sequence, a new word &lt;variable name&gt; is created.  Execution of this new word pushes the address to store the value of a variable onto the stack.  There are also constants in the fort, they are created like this: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">&lt;значение&gt; constant &lt;имя константы&gt;</code> </pre><br>  After creating a constant, the execution of the word &lt;constant name&gt; pushes &lt;value&gt; onto the stack. <br><br>  So, the word variable and the word constant are the word-generators.  They are designed to create new words.  In the fort, such words are described using the create ... does&gt; construct. <br><br>  Variables and constants can be defined as follows: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">: variable create <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span> , does&gt; ; : constant create , does&gt; @ ;</code> </pre><br>  What does all this mean? <br><br>  The word create, when executed, creates a new word with the name it takes when executing from the input stream.  After creation, a sequence of words is executed before the word does&gt;.  But at the moment of the execution of this word, what is written after it does&gt;.  In this case, the stack will already have the address of the data (as they say in the fort, "data fields"). <br><br>  Thus, when creating a variable, the sequence “0,” is executed - this is a reservation of a machine word with zero filling.  And in the execution of the created word, nothing is done (after does&gt; there is nothing).  The stack simply leaves the memory address where the value is stored. <br><br>  In the definition of a constant word is reserved with the filling of the value that is on the stack.  When the created word is executed, "@" is executed, which retrieves the value at the specified address. <br><br>  And now let's think about how the word we create can be arranged.  It puts the data address on the stack (like var0), and then transfers control to a specific address, to the bytecode.  The var0 command immediately returns.  But in this case we need to make not a return, but, in fact, a transition. <br><br>  I will state once again what needs to be done: <br><br><ul><li>  push data address </li><li>  make the transition to a piece of code after does&gt; </li></ul><br>  It turns out, you just need to transfer control to another bytecode address, but first put the address of the next byte (R8) on the stack. <br><br>  It's almost a branch team!  And we have not one.  Already have branch8 and branch16.  Let's call the new var8 and var16 commands, and let them be just entry points to the branch commands.  Save on the transition to the transition team :) So, it will be like this: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">b_var8 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x29</span></span> bcmd_var8: push r8 b_branch8 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x10</span></span> bcmd_branch8: movsx rax, byte ptr [r8] add r8, rax jmp _next b_var16 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x30</span></span> bcmd_var16: push r8 b_branch16 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x11</span></span> bcmd_branch16: movsx rax, word ptr [r8] add r8, rax jmp _next</code> </pre><br>  In a good way, the var32 command is not interfered yet, and the var64 too.  We do not have such long transitions, since ordinary transitions are not so long.  But for the var command this is quite a realistic case.  But for the time being we will not make these commands.  We will do it later, if necessary. <br><br>  With words-generators figured out.  It was the turn to determine the dictionary. <br><br><h4>  Vocabulary </h4><br>  Usually, when one speaks simply about a dictionary of a fort, it is presented in the form of a unidirectional list of entries.  In fact, everything is a bit more complicated, since the fort supports many dictionaries.  In fact, they are a tree.  Searching a word in such a tree begins with a “sheet” —this is the last word in the current dictionary.  The current dictionary is defined by the context variable, and the address of the last word is in the dictionary word.  To control the dictionaries is another variable - current, it determines the dictionary, where new words will be added.  Thus, one dictionary can be set up for searching, and another can be added to include new words. <br><br>  For our simple case, it would be possible not to support multiple vocabularies, but I decided not to simplify anything.  In fact, in order to understand the byte code, the byte machine, it is not necessary to know what is described in this section.  Therefore, who are not interested, you can simply skip this section.  Well, who wants to know the details - go ahead! <br><br>  Initially, there is a basic dictionary named forth.  This means that there is such a word - forth.  This word is also called "dictionary", there is some confusion in it.  Therefore, if we are talking about a word, I will call it a word dictionary. <br><br>  New dictionaries are created using this design: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">vocabulary &lt;имя создаваемого словаря&gt;</code> </pre><br>  This creates a word with the name &lt;name of the created dictionary&gt;.  When executed, this word will set the created dictionary as the starting one for the search. <br><br>  In fact, the word dictionary contains a link to the latest entry in this dictionary, from which the search begins.  And at the time of execution, this dictionary word writes a link to its data field in a context variable. <br><br>  Later it will be possible to make the word vocabulary, which on the fort, in the current implementation, is described quite simply: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">: vocabulary create context @ , does&gt; context ! ;</code> </pre><br>  So, create the word forth.  We will use the var8 command.  The byte code “context!” Will be placed immediately after the data field: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">forth: .byte b_var8 .byte does_voc - . - <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> .quad <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span> # &lt;-- Тут должен быть адрес последнего слова. Но я установлю его при инициализации, что бы в байт-коде не было прямых адресов. does_voc: .byte b_call8 .byte context - . - <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> .byte b_set .byte b_exit</code> </pre><br>  Now back to the creation of the dictionary itself. <br><br>  In general, in the fort, the description of a word in memory is called a “dictionary entry.”  In ordinary terms, I would say that there is an article title and its code.  But in the fort, everything is not quite usual; there it is called the "name field", the "communication field", the "code field" and the "data field".  I will try to tell you what it all means in traditional terms. <br><br>  The name field is the name of the word, “string with a counter”.  It's like in old pascal - the byte of the string length, then the string.  The link field is a link to the previous article.  Previously, there was just an address, but we will have platform-independent code, and this will be an offset.  The code field, traditionally in the fort, is machine code (when the implementation is in direct stitching), for words outside the core there was call _call.  We will just have a bytecode.  And the data field is for words containing data — for example, for variables or constants.  By the way, the word-dictionary also applies to it. <br><br>  For the compiler, we still need flags.  Usually, the fort needs only one flag — immediate, and it is placed in a byte of length (sometimes another one is hidden).  But this is for direct stitched code, where the processor control is transferred when calling to the code field.  And we have different words - bytecode and machine code, and you need at least two or even three flags. <br><br>  How much is needed for the communication field?  In the beginning I wanted to use 16 bits.  This is a link to the previous word, and the word is exactly less than 64 Kb.  But then I remembered that in a word there can be data of almost any size.  And besides, in the presence of several dictionaries, the link can go through many words.  So, in most cases, 8 bits will suffice, but maybe 16 and 32. And even 64 bits, if there is more than 4 GB of data.  Well, let's make support for all options.  Which option is used - put in the flags.  It turns out that at least 4 flags: a sign of immediate, a sign of the word of the core, and 2 bits per variant of the connection field used.  It is necessary to use a separate byte for flags, in any other way. <br><br>  Flags will be defined as: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">f_code = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x80</span></span> f_immediate = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x60</span></span></code> </pre><br>  The f_code flag will be in the kernel words written in assembler, the f_immediate flag will be useful for the compiler, about it in the next article.  And the two lower bits will determine the length of the communication field (1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes). <br><br>  So, the title of the article will be: <br><br><ul><li>  flags (1 byte) </li><li>  communication field (1-8 bytes) </li><li>  name length byte </li><li>  name (1-255 bytes) </li></ul><br>  Up to this point I have not used the possibility of "macro" assembler.  And now we need them.  So I got a macro named item to form the title of the word: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">.macro item name, flags = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span> link = . - p_item <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">9</span></span>: .<span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span> link &gt;= <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-256</span></span>/<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">2</span></span> &amp;&amp; link &lt; <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">256</span></span>/<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">2</span></span> .byte \flags .byte link .elseif link &gt;= <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-256</span></span>*<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">256</span></span>/<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">2</span></span> &amp;&amp; link &lt; <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">256</span></span>*<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">256</span></span>/<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">2</span></span> .byte \flags | <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> .word . - p_item .elseif link &gt;= <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-256</span></span>*<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">256</span></span>*<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">256</span></span>*<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">256</span></span>/<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">2</span></span> &amp;&amp; link &lt; <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">256</span></span>*<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">256</span></span>*<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">256</span></span>*<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">256</span></span>/<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">2</span></span> .byte \flags | <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">2</span></span> .<span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">int</span></span> . - p_item .elseif link &gt;= <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-256</span></span>*<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">256</span></span>*<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">256</span></span>*<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">256</span></span>*<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">256</span></span>*<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">256</span></span>*<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">256</span></span>*<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">256</span></span>/<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">2</span></span> &amp;&amp; link &lt; <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">256</span></span>*<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">256</span></span>*<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">256</span></span>*<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">256</span></span>*<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">256</span></span>*<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">256</span></span>*<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">256</span></span>*<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">256</span></span>/<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">2</span></span> .byte \flags | <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">3</span></span> .quad . - p_item .endif p_item = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">9b</span></span> .byte <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">9f</span></span> - . - <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> .ascii <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"\name"</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">9</span></span>: .endm</code> </pre><br>  This macro uses the value p_item - this is the address of the previous dictionary entry.  This value is updated at the end for later use: p_item = 9b.  Here 9b is a label, not a number, you should not confuse :) The macro has two parameters - the name of the word and flags (optional).  At the beginning of the macro, the offset to the previous word is calculated.  Then, depending on the size of the offset, the flags and the communication field of the desired size are compiled.  Then the length byte of the name and the name itself. <br><br>  We define before the first word p_item like this: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">p_item = .</code> </pre><br>  The dot is the current compilation address in assembler.  As a result of this definition, the first word will refer to itself (the communication field will be 0).  This is a sign of the end of dictionaries. <br><br>  By the way, what will be in the code field of the core words?  It is necessary, at least, somewhere to save the command code.  I decided to go as far as possible.  For the kernel words, there will also be a bytecode.  For most teams, this will be just a byte command, and then b_exit.  Thus, for the interpreter, the f_code flag is not necessary to analyze, and the commands for it will not differ in any way.  It will be necessary just to call bytecode for everyone. <br><br>  For this option there is another advantage.  For commands with parameters, you can set secure parameters.  For example, if you invoke the command lit in implementations of a fort with directly sewn code, the system will crash.  And here it will be written, for example, lit 0, and this sequence will simply put 0 on the stack.  Even for a branch you can do it safely! <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs"> .byte branch8 .byte <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0f</span></span> - . <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span>: .byte b_exit</code> </pre><br>  With such a call there will be some overhead, but for the interpreter they will not be significant.  And the compiler will analyze the flags, and compile the correct and fast code. <br><br>  The first word will be, of course, the word “forth” - this is the basic dictionary we create.  This is where the var command comes in handy with a link to the code after does&gt;.  I already cited this code in the previous section, but I will repeat it again, with the title: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">p_item = . item forth .byte b_var8 .byte does_voc - . - <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> .quad <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span> does_voc: .byte b_call8 .byte context - . - <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> .byte b_set .byte b_exit</code> </pre><br>  And we will immediately make context and current variables, we will need them to search for words: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs"> item current .byte b_var0 .quad <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span> item context context: .byte b_var0 .quad <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span></code> </pre><br>  And now, you have to be patient, and set a title for each word that we wrote in assembly language, with the f_code flag: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs"> item <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span>, f_code .byte b_num0 .byte b_exit item <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span>, f_code .byte b_num1 .byte b_exit ... item <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span>-, f_code .byte b_wm .byte b_exit item <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span>+, f_code .byte b_wp .byte b_exit item +, f_code .byte b_add .byte b_exit item -, f_code .byte b_sub .byte b_exit item *, f_code .byte b_mul .byte b_exit</code> </pre><br>  And so on… <br><br>  With commands written in bytecode is even easier.  Just add a header before the bytecode, just like the word forth, for example: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs"> item hold hold: .byte b_call8 .byte holdpoint - . - <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> <span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta"># holdpoint ...</span></span></code> </pre><br>  For commands with parameters, we will make safe parameters.  For example, the lit commands let them return the Pi number, if someone calls them interactively, there will be such a paschal :) <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs"> item lit8, f_code .byte b_lit8 .byte <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">31</span></span> .byte b_exit item lit16, f_code .byte b_lit16 .word <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">31415</span></span> .byte b_exit item lit32, f_code .byte b_lit32 .<span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">int</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">31415926</span></span> .byte b_exit item lit64, f_code .byte b_lit64 .quad <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">31415926535</span></span> .byte b_exit</code> </pre><br>  The last word in the list is symbolic to make the word bye.  But we still need to write the address of this word in the data field forth during initialization.  To get the address of this word, use the var0 command: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">last_item: .byte b_var0 item bye, f_code .byte b_bye</code> </pre><br>  In this design, if we call the address of last_item in bytecode, we will get the address of the word bye.  To write it in the data fields of the word forth, execute forth, and the desired address will be in context.  Thus, the system initialization code will be as follows: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">forth last_item context @ !</code> </pre><br>  Now let's proceed directly to the interpreter.  To begin, we need to work with the input buffer and extract words from it.  Let me remind you that the interpreter in the fort is very simple.  It extracts words from the input buffer in succession, tries to find them.  If the word is found, the interpreter launches it for execution. <br><br><h4>  Input buffer and word extraction </h4><br>  To be honest, I do not want to spend a lot of time studying the standards of the fort.  But still I will try to do as close as possible to them, mainly from memory.  If the experts of the fort will see a strong non-compliance here - write, I will correct. <br><br>  To work with the buffer, the fort has three variables: tib, #tib, and&gt; in.  The variable tib pushes the input buffer address onto the stack.  The variable #tib pushes onto the stack the number of characters that are in the buffer.  And the variable&gt; in contains the offset in the input buffer, beyond which is the raw text.  We define these variables. <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs"> item tib .byte b_var0 v_tib: .quad <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span> item <span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta">#tib .byte b_var0 v_ntib: .quad 0 item &gt;in .byte b_var0 v_in: .quad 0</span></span></code> </pre><br>  Next we make the word blword.  This word, using the specified variables, receives the following word from the input stream.  Spaces are used as separators and all characters with a code less than a space.  This word will be in assembler.  After debugging it turned out like this: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">b_blword = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0xF0</span></span> bcmd_blword: mov rsi, v_tib # адрес текстового буфера mov rdx, rsi # сохраним в RDX начало текстового буфера для последующего использования mov rax, v_in # смещение в текстовом буфере mov rcx, v_ntib # размер текстового буфера add rsi, rax # теперь RSI - указатель на начало обрабатываемого текста sub rcx, rax # получили количество оставшихся символов jz <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">3f</span></span> word2: lodsb # загрузка в AL по RSI с инкрементом cmp al, <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">' '</span></span> ja <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1f</span></span> # пропускаем все разделители (пробел или с кодом меньше) dec rcx jnz word2 # цикл по пробелам <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">3</span></span>: sub rsi, rdx mov v_in, rsi push rcx jmp _next <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span>: lea rdi, [rsi - <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span>] # RDI = RSI - <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> (начало слова) dec rcx word3: lodsb cmp al, <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">' '</span></span> jbe <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">2f</span></span> dec rcx jnz word3 <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">2</span></span>: mov rax, rsi sub rsi, rdx # смещение на первый символ после первого разделителя (для поиска следующего слова) mov v_in, rsi sub rax, rdi dec rax jz word1 push rdi # начало слова word1: push rax # длина слова jmp _next</code> </pre><br>  This word is similar to the standard word, but, in contrast, takes into account all delimiters and does not copy the word into the buffer.  It returns just two values ​​on the stack — the address and the length.  If the word cannot be retrieved, returns 0. It is time to start writing the interpreter. <br><br><h4>  Word search and interpreter </h4><br>  First, let's do the word interpret.  This word selects a new word from the buffer using blworld, searches for it in the dictionary and executes it.  And so repeats until the buffer is exhausted.  We do not yet have the opportunity to search for a word, so we will write a test plug, which will simply output the word from the buffer using type.  This will give us the opportunity to check and debug blworld: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs"># : interpret begin blword dup <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">while</span></span> type repeat drop ; item interpret <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span>: .byte b_blword .byte b_dup .byte b_qnbranch8 .byte <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0f</span></span> - . .byte b_type .byte b_branch8 .byte <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1b</span></span> - . <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span>: .byte b_drop .byte b_exit</code> </pre><br>  Now make the word quit.  This is usually done in the implementation of fort systems: they use the word quit or abort to enter interpreter mode.  The word quit resets stacks and starts an endless loop of input to the buffer and interpretation.  With us, this is just an interpret call.  The code of this word will consist of two parts.  The first part will be in assembler, the second part will be in bytecode.  First part: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">b_quit = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0xF1</span></span> bcmd_quit: lea r8, quit mov sp, init_stack mov bp, init_rstack jmp _next</code> </pre><br>  The second part of: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">quit: .byte b_call16 .word interpret - . - <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">2</span></span> .byte b_bye</code> </pre><br>  As usual, the assembler code is located in the .text section, the bytecode is located in the .data section. <br><br>  And finally, change the start bytecode.  There will only be initialization of the dictionary, setting the buffer on the starting line, and calling quit. <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta"># forth last_item context @ ! start_code tib ! </span><span class="hljs-meta-string"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta-string">&lt;длина стартового кода&gt; #tib ! quit start: .byte b_call16 .word forth - . - 2 .byte b_call16 .word last_item - . - 2 .byte b_call16 .word context - . - 2 .byte b_get .byte b_set .byte b_call8 .byte start_code - . - 1 .byte b_call16 .word tib - . - 2 .byte b_set .byte b_lit16 .world 1f - 0f .byte b_call16 .word ntib - . - 2 .byte b_set .byte b_quit start_code: .byte b_var0 0: .ascii "word1 word2 word3" 1:</span></span></span></span></code> </pre><br>  Compile, link, run! <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">$ as forth.s -o forth.o -g -ahlsm &gt;list.txt $ ld forth.o -o forth $ ./forth word1word2wordBye!</code> </pre><br>  A bit like porridge, but this is exactly the result.  We output without separators.  By the way, we will put the line break before buy for the future, it will not hurt. <br><br>  Of course, I had to tinker with debugging.  In addition to the “Segmentation fault (core dumped)” already mentioned, sometimes interesting results were obtained.  For example, such: <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">$ ./forth word1word2word3forth)%60Acurrent(context(%600lit8lit16zlit32v%5E%DF%80lit64v%5E%DF%80call8call16call32branch8branch16qbranch8qbranch16exit1-+!-%22*#/$mod%25/mod&amp;abs'dup0drop1swap2rot3-rot4over5pick6roll7depth8@@!Ac@Bc!Cw@Dw!Ei@Fi!G0=P0%3CQ0%3ER=S%3CT%3EU%3C=V%3E=Wvar8)var160base(holdbuf(Qholdpoint(hold@0U110ACp@&amp;20T0!?!%3CgF!A0@RF!5%220'%DE%A61Q-%DD%80:tib(%7F%60(%3Ein(%20%20%20%20%20%20%20interpret01('byeSegmentation%20fault%20(core%20dumped)</code> </pre><br>  It seems to be right in our entire dictionary in binary form with text cut into delimiters :) It happened when I forgot “dec rcx” before word3 in the b_blword command. <br><br>  We can choose words from the input stream, there is a dictionary.  Now we need to implement a dictionary search and the launch of words for execution.  This will require the words find, cfa and execute. <br><br>  The word find will retrieve the address of the word and its length from the stack.  Return this word will be the address of the dictionary entry or 0 if not found. <br><br>  The word cfa at the address of the article calculates the address of the executable bytecode. <br><br>  And the word execute will execute the bytecode. <br><br>  Let's start with find.  In the standards of the fort it takes one address - a line with a counter.  But I do not want to once again copy the string to the buffer, so I deviate a little from the standards.  The word find will take two parameters on the stack — the address and the length of the string (actually, what the word blword returns).  After debugging, this word took the following form: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">b_find = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0xF2</span></span> bcmd_find: pop rbx # длина имени pop r9 # адрес имени mov rdx, v_context mov rdx, [rdx] # получили адрес последней словарной статьи для поиска # цикл поиска find0: mov al, [rdx] # флаги <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">and</span></span> al, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">3</span></span> # два младших - это вариангт длинны поля связи, остальные флаги нас не интересуют, они для компилятора <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">or</span></span> al, al jz find_l8 cmp al, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> jz find_l16 cmp al, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">2</span></span> jz find_l32 mov r10, [rdx + <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span>] # смещение <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">64</span></span> бита lea rsi, [rdx + <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">9</span></span>] # адрес имени jmp find1 find_l32: movsx r10, dword ptr [rdx + <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span>] # смещение <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">32</span></span> бита lea rsi, [rdx + <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">5</span></span>] # адрес имени jmp find1 find_l16: movsx r10, word ptr [rdx + <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span>] # смещение <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">16</span></span> бит lea rsi, [rdx + <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">3</span></span>] # адрес имени jmp find1 find_l8: movsx r10, byte ptr [rdx + <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span>] # смещение <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">8</span></span> бит lea rsi, [rdx + <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">2</span></span>] # адрес имени find1: movzx rax, byte ptr [rsi] # длина имени из проверяемой словарной статьи cmp rax, rbx jz find2 # имя не совпало по длине find3: <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">or</span></span> r10, r10 jz find_notfound # конец поиска, слово не найдено add rdx, r10 # переходим к следующей статье jmp find0 # длина совпала, сравниваем строки find2: inc rsi mov rdi, r9 mov rcx, rax repz cmpsb jnz find3 # слово найдено push rdx jmp _next find_notfound: push r10 jmp _next</code> </pre><br> Пожалуй, это самое сложное на сегодня слово. Теперь модифицируем слово interpret, заменив type на «find .»: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs"># : interpret begin blword dup <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">while</span></span> find . repeat drop ; item interpret interpret: .byte b_blword .byte b_dup .byte b_qnbranch8 .byte <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0f</span></span> - . .byte b_find .byte b_call16 .word dot - . - <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">2</span></span> .byte b_branch8 .byte interpret - . <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span>: .byte b_drop .byte b_exit</code> </pre><br> В тестовой строке надо поставить слова, которые есть в словаре, например «0 1- dup + .». <br><br> Все готово к запуску! <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">$ ld forth.o -o forth $ ./forth 6297733 6297898 6298375 Bye!</code> </pre><br> Отлично, поиск работает. Это адреса слов (в десятичной системе счисления). Теперь слово cfa. Пусть оно тоже будет на ассемблере, оно очень простое, работа с флагами похожа на find: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">b_cfa = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0xF3</span></span> bcmd_cfa: pop rdx # адрес словарной статьи mov al, [rdx] # флаги <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">and</span></span> al, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">3</span></span> # два младших - это вариангт длинны поля связи, остальные флаги нас не интересуют, они для компилятора <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">or</span></span> al, al jz cfa_l8 cmp al, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> jz cfa_l16 cmp al, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">2</span></span> jz cfa_l32 lea rsi, [rdx + <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">9</span></span>] # адрес имени (<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">64</span></span> бита ссылка) jmp cfa1 find_l32: lea rsi, [rdx + <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">5</span></span>] # адрес имени (<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">32</span></span> бита ссылка) jmp cfa1 find_l16: lea rsi, [rdx + <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">3</span></span>] # адрес имени (<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">16</span></span> бит ссылка) jmp cfa1 find_l8: lea rsi, [rdx + <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">2</span></span>] # адрес имени (<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">8</span></span> бита ссылка) xor rax, rax lodsb add rsi, rax push rsi jmp _next</code> </pre><br> И, наконец, слово execute, оно еще проще: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">b_execute = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0xF4</span></span> bcmd_execute: sub rbp, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">8</span></span> mov [rbp], r8 # сохраняем в стеке возвратов адрес возврата pop r8 # адрес байт-кода jmp _next</code> </pre><br> Исправляем слово interpret и запускаем! <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs"># : interpret begin blword dup <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">while</span></span> find cfa execute repeat drop ; item interpret interpret: .byte b_blword .byte b_dup .byte b_qnbranch8 .byte <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0f</span></span> - . .byte b_find .byte b_cfa .byte b_execute .byte b_branch8 .byte interpret - . <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span>: .byte b_drop .byte b_exit</code> </pre><br>  Run: <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">$ as forth.s -o forth.o -g -ahlsm &gt;list.txt $ ld forth.o -o forth $ ./forth -2 Bye!</code> </pre><br> Уррра, заработало! <s>(С) Кот Матроскин</s> <br><br> Действительно, если из 0 вычесть 1, и сложить полученный результат с самим собой, будет -2 :) <br> Это замечательно, но хочется все-же понабирать команды с клавиатуры. И, есть еще одна проблема — наш интерпретатор понимает только числа 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 и 8 (которые определены как константы). Что бы он научился понимать любые числа, потребуется слово «number?». Точно так же, как и для слова find, не буду использовать буфер. Слово «number?» будет принимать в стеке два параметра — адрес строки и длину. В случае успеха, оно будет возвращать полученное число и флаг 1. Если преобразование не удалось, на стеке будет лежать одно число: 0. <br><br> Код получился длинный, но довольно простой и линейный: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">b_number = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0xF5</span></span> bcmd_number: pop rcx # длина строки pop rsi # адрес xor rax, rax # преобрахуемое число xor rbx, rbx # тут будет преобразуемая цифра mov r9, v_base # база xor r10, r10 # знак числа <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">or</span></span> rcx, rcx jz num_false mov bl, [rsi] cmp bl, <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'+'</span></span> jnz <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1f</span></span> inc rsi dec rcx jz num_false jmp num0 <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span>: cmp bl, <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'-'</span></span> jnz num0 mov r10, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> inc rsi dec rcx jz num_false num0: mov bl, [rsi] cmp bl, <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'0'</span></span> ja num_false cmp bl, <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'9'</span></span> jae num_09 cmp bl, <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'A'</span></span> ja num_false cmp bl, <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'Z'</span></span> jae num_AZ cmp bl, <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'a'</span></span> ja num_false sub bl, <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'a'</span></span> - <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">10</span></span> jmp num_check num_AZ: sub bl, <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'A'</span></span> - <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">10</span></span> jmp num_check num_09: sub bl, <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'0'</span></span> num_check: cmp rbx, r9 jge num_false add rax, rbx mul r9 inc rsi dec rcx jnz num0 <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">or</span></span> r10, r10 push rax push <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> jmp _next num_false: xor rcx, rcx push rcx jmp _next</code> </pre><br> Модифицируем interpret.

После такой «трассировки» команда заработала сразу! <br><br> Для отладки я создал такие макросы: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">.macro prs new_line = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> .byte b_call16 .word prstack - . - <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">2</span></span> .<span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span> \new_line &gt; <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span> .byte b_lit8, <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'\n'</span></span> .byte b_emit .endif .endm</code> </pre><br> Использовал, вставляя в нужные места таким образом: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs"> item interpret interpret: .byte b_blword prs .byte b_dup prs .byte b_qnbranch8 .byte <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0f</span></span> - . .byte b_over .byte b_over ......</code> </pre><br> В результате, первый же запуск выдал такой вывод: <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">$ ./forth (2 ): 6297664 1 (3 ): 6297664 1 1 (3 ): 2 6297666 1 (4 ): 2 6297666 1 1 (4 ): 2 3 6297668 1 (5 ): 2 3 6297668 1 1 (3 ): 6 6297670 2 (4 ): 6 6297670 2 2 (4 ): 6 6297670 6297673 1 (5 ): 6 6297670 6297673 1 1 6297670 (2 ): 6 0 (3 ): 6 0 0 Bye!</code> </pre><br> Каждое движение в стеке можно рассмотреть как на ладони.

Это ситуация, обратная переполнению, когда пытаются взять больше, чем положили. Добавил ее контроль в ".s". <br> С помощью новых макросов отладка прошла быстро. Кстати, до этого я размещал по одному байт-коду в строке. Но ассемблер позволяет размещать несколько байтов в строке, почему бы этим не пользоваться. <br><br> Давайте завершим слово interpret, добавив две проверки: что слово не преобразовалось в число и на выход стека за границу. В результате, interpret получается такой: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs"> item interpret interpret: .byte b_blword .byte b_dup .byte b_qnbranch8 .byte <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0f</span></span> - . .byte b_over .byte b_over .byte b_find .byte b_dup .byte b_qnbranch8 .byte <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1f</span></span> - . .byte b_mrot .byte b_drop .byte b_drop .byte b_cfa .byte b_execute .byte b_branch8 .byte <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">2f</span></span> - . <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span>: .byte b_drop .byte b_over, b_over .byte b_numberq # проверка, что число преобразовалось .byte b_qbranch8, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">3f</span></span> - . # если на стеке не <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span>, значит, преобразовалось и идем на метку <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">3</span></span> .byte b_type # иначе печатаем слово .byte b_strp # потом диагностику .byte <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">19</span></span> # это длинна сообщения ниже .ascii <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">" : word not found!\n"</span></span> .byte b_quit # и завершаем интерпретацию <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">3</span></span>: .byte b_nip, b_nip # удалим значения, сохраненные для печати слова (команды b_over, b_over) <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">2</span></span>: # проверка стека на выход за границу .byte b_depth # получаем глубину стека .byte b_zlt # сравниваем, что меньше <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span> (команда <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span>&lt;) .byte b_qnbranch8, interpret_ok - . # если условие ложно, то все в порядке, делаем переход .byte b_strp # иначе выводим диагностику .byte <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">14</span></span> .ascii <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"\nstack fault!\n"</span></span> .byte b_quit # и завершаем интерпретацию interpret_ok: .byte b_branch8 .byte interpret - . <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span>: .byte b_drop .byte b_exit</code> </pre><br> Кстати, стоит обратить внимание, что сейчас команда quit сбрасывает стеки и заново запускает интерпретацию, не изменяя состояния буфера. Таким образом, интерпретация продолжиться, но со «свежими» стеками. Мы исправим это чуть позже. <br><br> Осталось дело за малым — организовать ввод с клавиатуры. <br><br><h4> Ввод с клавиатуры </h4><br> Ввод с клавиатуры в форте устроен просто. Есть слово expect, оно принимает два параметра — адрес буфера и его размер. Это слово выполняет ввод с клавиатуры. Реально введенное количество символов помещает в переменную span. Сделаем эти слова. Вводить будем со стандартного ввода. <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">.data item span span: .byte b_var0 v_span: .quad <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span> .text b_expect = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x88</span></span> bcmd_expect: mov rax, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span> # системный вызов № <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> - sys_read mov rdi, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span> # поток № <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> - <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">stdout</span></span> pop rdx # длинна буфера pop rsi # адрес буфера push r8 syscall # вызов ядра pop r8 mov rbx, rax <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">or</span></span> rax, rax jge <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1f</span></span> xor rbx, rbx <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span>: mov v_span, rbx jmp _next</code> </pre><br> Теперь нам нужно создать буфер ввода с клавиатуры. Пусть он будет размером 256 символов. <br> Сделаем его на месте предыдущей тестовой строки. <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">inbuf_size = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">256</span></span> inbuf: .byte b_var0 .space inbuf_size</code> </pre><br> И модифицируем quit, а так же стартовый байт-код. Переменную tib устанавливаем на буфер ввода inbuf, вызываем expect, затем значение из span копируем в #tib. Переменную &gt;in обнуляем, вызываем interpret. И так повторяем в цикле. Остаются фенечки — добавить приглашение ввода и неплохо бы выводить состояние стека (а у нас уже есть готовая команда для этого!). После нескольких итераций получился такой код (стартовый и команда quit): <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta"># forth last_item context @ ! quit start: .byte b_call16 .word forth - . - 2 .byte b_call16 .word last_item - . - 2 .byte b_call16 .word context - . - 2 .byte b_get .byte b_set .byte b_quit inbuf: .byte b_var0 .space inbuf_size # begin inbuf dup tib ! inbuf_size expect span @ #tib ! 0 &gt;in ! interpret again quit: .byte b_strp, 1 .ascii </span><span class="hljs-meta-string"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta-string">"\n"</span></span></span><span class="hljs-meta"> .byte b_call16 .word prstack - . - 2 .byte b_strp .byte 2 .ascii </span><span class="hljs-meta-string"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta-string">"&gt; "</span></span></span><span class="hljs-meta"> .byte b_call16 .word inbuf - . - 2 .byte b_dup .byte b_call16 .word tib - . - 2 .byte b_set .byte b_lit16 .word inbuf_size .byte b_expect .byte b_call16 .word span - . - 2 .byte b_get .byte b_call16 .word ntib - . - 2 .byte b_set .byte b_num0 .byte b_call16 .word bin - . - 2 .byte b_set .byte b_call16 .word interpret - . - 2 .byte b_branch8, quit - .</span></span></code> </pre><br> И вот результат: <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">$ ./forth ( 0 ): &gt; 60 ( 1 ): 60 &gt; 60 24 ( 3 ): 60 60 24 &gt; rot ( 3 ): 60 24 60 &gt; -rot ( 3 ): 60 60 24 &gt; swap ( 3 ): 60 24 60 &gt; * * . 86400 ( 0 ): &gt; 200 30 /mod ( 2 ): 20 6 &gt; bye Bye! $</code> </pre><br> Все, что после символа "&gt;" — это мой ввод с клавиатуры. Остальное — ответ системы. Немного поигрался командами, набирая с клавиатуры. Выполнил несколько стековых операций, вычислил число секунд в сутках. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br> Интерпретатор в сборе и работает. И вежливо прощается — ему «пока» и он «пока» :) <br> В качестве приглашения — содержимое арифметического стека. Первое число в скобках — размер стека, дальше содержимое, и приглашение для ввода "&gt;". Можно вводить любые реализованные команды (я насчитал 76 команд). Правда, многие имеют смысл только для компилятора — например, литералы, переходы, команды вызова. <br><br><div class="spoiler"> <b class="spoiler_title">Полный исходник (около 1300 строк)</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">.intel_syntax noprefix stack_size = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1024</span></span> f_code = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x80</span></span> f_immediate = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x60</span></span> .macro item name, flags = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span> link = p_item -

У кого Linux, можно скачать и запустить. <br><br> А у кого Windows — можно поставить WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). На праздники я уезжал, и именно так и сделал. Это оказалось очень просто, заняло минут 5. Единственный был момент, сразу не запустилась, подсистему надо было «включить» через команду PowerShell. Прошел по ссылке из сообщения об ошибке, выполнил команду, и все заработало. <br><br> Но есть еще и путь настоящих индейцев — запустить все это под Windows :) Сделать это не сложно, достаточно переделать несколько слов, взаимодействующих с системой. <br><br>  That's all! В следующий раз запилим компилятор. <br><br> Будет возможность компилировать новые слова, будут условия, циклы. Собственно, можно будет писать на более-менее стандартном форте, компилировать в байт-код и исполнять. Ну и можно будет провести уже более серьезные тесты, проверить быстродействие байт-машины. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/435236/">https://habr.com/ru/post/435236/</a></p>
