It would be naive to believe that Hollywood studios, copyright holders and fighters with pirates will leave everything as it is and will not look for the culprits.  Many are engaged in their search, including the FBI.  And the first results of such active work have already appeared: a 31-year-old man from Lancaster is arrested, who is accused of loading copies of Survivor and Snoopy and Chubby Cinema into a private tracker Pass The Popcorn. <br><br>  Let me remind you that in December last year a large number of films in DVD-quality hit the Web, and the number of downloads of these films reaches many millions of copies.  At the same time, screeners hit the Internet even before the pre-release viewing. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Kyle Moriarty (not a professor, no) from Lancaster was <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/fbi-busts-movie-industry-insider-for-dvd-screener-leaks-160228/">found guilty</a> of copying the screenshots of the above two films.  He did this while working in one of the studios.  Both copies were uploaded to a private BitTorrent PTP (Pass The Popcorn) tracker, from which films were distributed throughout the Internet.  Moriarty has already concluded a pre-trial agreement with the plaintiffs, pleading guilty. <br><br>  Moriarty copied the films on the flash drive first, and went home with them.  After decoding releases, he uploaded them to the said tracker.  The films have been downloaded several million times, which makes it possible to talk about huge amounts as lost profits for film studios.  Fox estimates its losses at a minimum of $ 1.12 million. <br><br>  In court documents, the employer Moriarty is not specified, but <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/buster/copyright/FBI-busts-revenant-pirate-183297">there is evidence</a> to suggest that he worked in the show ‚ÄúDr.  Phil ‚Äù(production coordinator), which means it is related to Paramount Studios. <br><br>  As far as one can understand, Moriarty unloaded movies from his home IP without using any encryption, no proxy, or anything else.  From this data, and found him.  As for the group Hive-CM8, which organized the leakage of a much larger number of films, the man has nothing to do with it.  The ‚Äúsurvivor‚Äù got into the Network only thanks to Moriarty, Hive-CM8 has nothing to do with it. <br><br>  Due to the imprisonment of pre-trial detention, Moriarty is awaiting a sentence with a maximum sentence of three years in prison.  The sentence must be passed within the next few months. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/391181/">https://habr.com/ru/post/391181/</a></p>
