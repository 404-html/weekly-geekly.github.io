Make a resume from Lego</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fd3/e42/cd7/fd3e42cd796045549f44299035f40e67.jpg"><br><br><h6>  The man not only made sure that his resume looked good, but also came up with his strategy.  Boxes with elements that can be assembled and blind the ideal candidate - isn‚Äôt it brilliant?  Leah wrote on her resume that she was the cube they had been waiting for.  It may be arrogant, but as creative. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c74/08a/920/c7408a92032d40f8b8810de1c93b95e5.jpg"><br><br>  And you know what?  It worked!  Leah Bowman first got a job as an intern at an advertising agency in Chicago, and then she was picked up, and in general this is a story with a happy ending, that is, the beginning of a career path. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>2. Make an interactive video</b> </h4><br><h6>  Grami Anthony - a specialist in the field of PR.  He decided that he needed to find a new way to communicate with recruiters and removed the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D9EzNll1U2N8%26feature%3Dyoutu.be">CVIV</a> . <br><br>  Right in the process of viewing you can choose what interests you: ‚Äúabout yourself‚Äù, ‚Äúportfolio‚Äù, ‚Äútimeline‚Äù, ‚Äúskills‚Äù, ‚Äúcontacts‚Äù.  The guy sent this video to so many recruiters and the reaction was immediate.  He was called for an interview countless times, since then he has already changed jobs several times, but his resume is gaining popularity - 400,000 views, is this a joke? </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>3. Buy Google Ads</b> </h4><br><h6>  What if we say that only $ 6 (we won‚Äôt even try to transfer money into rubles) can help you find a great job? <br>  That is how Alec Bronstein decided to invest.  He <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D7FRwCs99DWg%26feature%3Dyoutu.be">bought ads on Google targeting some of the TOPs of the ad world</a> .  For example, aimed at a certain Reichental.  Here, look at how this experiment looked: <br>  The CEO of an advertising agency with an unpronounceable last name who saw this made it possible for Alec to come in for an interview and took him to work. <br>  Now this guy is the creative director of Dollar Shave Club. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>4. Make a resume in the style of the site of the employer</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a07/b0f/a99/a07b0fa99315460b8d275f9a1e5ae5bd.jpg"><br><h6>  How to convince that you deserve a place in a company like Pinterest?  Just show that you know him far and wide! <br>  Gianna made her page on Pinterest completely indistinguishable from the resume.  She showed that she really really, really wants to work there.  But she wasn‚Äôt taken on Pinterest yet, but she was called to Pintics, a resource that deals with analytics.  After graduating from Harvard Business School, the girl quickly moved up the career ladder, worked in start-ups and large companies, and engaged in impressive projects (3D printing, for example). </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>5. Buy a billboard</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/84b/f3a/d8a/84bf3ad8a08d476a823d921967346355.jpg"><br><h6>  If nothing else helped, then just buy a billboard.  No, well, really! <br>  Adam Pacitti, a graduate of 2012, sent his resume to 250 companies.  And no one answered him (you are not the only one, yes!).  Then he spent his last 500 pounds on a billboard.  And he was invited to 60 interviews.  And his creativity was appreciated by people all over the world. <br>  <a href="http://adampacitti.com/about.html">His website</a> is still being visited and told about it on the BBC, CNN, CBS.  So it seems that 500 pounds paid off. </h6></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296746/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296746/</a></p>
