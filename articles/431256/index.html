  <section class="page js-page"><h1>UK and Holland fined Uber for $ 1.2 million for leaking personal data</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  The authorities of Great Britain and the Netherlands fined European Uber with $ 1.2 million for the leak of personal data of 7 million drivers and 57 million passengers, which occurred in 2016.  Including information was stolen about 2.7 million passengers and 82 thousand drivers from the UK and 174 thousand citizens of the Netherlands.  For comparison, in the US, Uber agreed to pay $ 148 million for a pre-trial settlement. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sz/qz/0k/szqz0ke9osuxaygkfpyteblvyr4.png"></p><br><p><a name="habracut"></a>  The compromised information contained names, email addresses and telephone numbers, as well as 600 thousand US driver's license numbers. <cut></cut></p><br><p>  Let me remind you that in October 2016, Uber was paid to an attacker, who turned out to be a 20-year-old American, $ 100,000 for deleting data and not advertising the fact of personal data theft. </p><br><p>  The general public about this incident became known on November 21, 2017, when the new head of Uber Dara Hosrovshahi made a statement.  He said that there was no hacking of the company's internal IT system.  According to him, the company uses a third-party cloud storage service, on which the stolen information was placed and to which the extortionist got access. </p><br><p>  In this particular case, we are talking about two cloud services at once: GitHub and Amazon Web Services (AWS).  GitHub is the largest service for joint development and storage of source codes, where the Uber developers saved the access keys to the company's account in AWS.  Since the source repository is open, anyone could get information to access Uber data stored in the Amazon cloud.  Having gained access to AWS, using a key from GitHub, the attacker downloaded from there 16 files with personal data.  About the prevention of data leaks on GitHub, we wrote a <a href="https://habr.com/company/devicelockdlp/blog/429796/">separate article on Habr√©</a> . </p><br><p>  It should be noted that these penalties of the authorities of Great Britain and Holland were imposed even before the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) entered into force. </p><br><p>  Regular news about individual cases of data leakage, promptly published on the channel <a href="https://tele.click/dataleak"><strong>Information Leaks</strong></a> . </p></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/431256/">https://habr.com/ru/post/431256/</a></p>
