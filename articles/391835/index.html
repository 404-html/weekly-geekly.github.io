Electric vehicles, although no longer a novelty, are within the law of such countries the same as cars with internal combustion engines.  Of course, this situation is not typical for all states, but the same Singapore has already managed to distinguish itself. <br><br>  Now a funny situation has arisen in Kazakhstan.  Here, however, no one fined anyone, just a group of Tesla electric cars were detained at the entrance to the Medeu high-mountain complex (it is located in the vicinity of Almaty).  The traffic police officers of Kazakhstan, who were guided by the decree of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, detained the cars.  The decree prohibits entry of vehicles into the complex, for environmental reasons. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  One of the band members recorded a video that, in general, is boring, but there is something interesting.  For example, on the road past the same traffic policemen, a bus is quietly traveling, which clearly emit more harmful substances into the atmosphere than Tesla (the latter, except that dust on the road is capable of raising). <br><br>  The traffic police explained that they were aware of what Tesla electric cars are and how they work, but the decree is a decree. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/KaksQfqdMOI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgu52v7RtuTN-GB81Kf_lVK9KDfDw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  ‚ÄúToday we are the club of owners of electric vehicles TESLA" Kazakhstan Tesla Club "decided to climb the high-mountainous complex MEDEU.  After the presidential decree, the cars at MEDEU and CHIMBULAK stopped running to save the environment.  The traffic police also did not let into the territory and our electric vehicles, despite the fact that they absolutely do not pollute the environment!  Entry only for ECO TAXI that moves in Gaza.  The video clearly shows how the bus drove the exhaust smoke that followed it. Please request to the Akimat to work out permission of the entry to the Chimbulak of electric vehicles.  This is a good example for others to use an environmentally friendly mode of transport! ‚Äù, - Sanzhar Altayev, one of the club members ( <i>spelling and punctuation of the author of the record is kept</i> ) <i>writes</i> . <br><br>  As mentioned above, something similar happens in other countries, not only the CIS.  For example, the owner of the Tesla Model S <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/272396/">was fined</a> by Singapore authorities for exceeding the CO2 emissions standard.  At the same time, the owner of the electric car initially expected to receive tax benefits of about $ 11,000, but instead he received a fine of almost the same size. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/391835/">https://habr.com/ru/post/391835/</a></p>
