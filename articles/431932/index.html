I'll start in order.  Recently here, on Habré, articles on bytecode began to appear.  And once upon a time I was amused by what the fort system was writing.  Of course, in assembly language.  They were 16 bit.  On x86-64 never programmed.  Even with 32 it was not possible to play.  So the thought came - why not?  Why not stir up a 64-bit fort, and even with a byte-code?  Yes, and on Linux, where I also did not write anything system. <br><br>  I have a home server with Linux.  In general, I googled a bit and found out that the assembler on Linux is called GAS, and the as command.  Connecting via SSH to the server, typing as - is!  I have it already installed.  I still need a linker, I type ld - there is!  So, and try to write something interesting in assembly language.  Without civilization, only forest, like real Indians :) Without development environment, only command line and Midnight Commander.  The editor will be Nano, which hangs on my F4 in mc.  How is the Zero band singing?  A real Indian needs only one thing ... What else does a real Indian need?  Of course, debugger.  We type gdb - there is!  Well, let's press Shift + F4, and go! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Architecture </h2><br>  For a start, we will define architecture.  With digit capacity already defined, 64 bits.  In the classic implementations of the fort, the data and code segment is the same.  But, we will try to do it right.  We will only have code in the code segment, data in the data segment.  As a result, you get a kernel for the platform and a completely platform independent bytecode. <br><br>  Let's try to make the fastest possible stack byte-machine (but without JIT).  So, we will have a table containing 256 addresses - one for each byte-command.  There is nothing less - an extra check, this is already 1-2 processor commands.  And we need to quickly, without compromise. <br><br><h4>  Stacks </h4><br>  Usually, in implementations of a fort, the processor's return (* SP) stack is used as a data stack, and the return stack is implemented by other means.  Indeed, our machine will have a stack, and the main work goes on the data stack.  Therefore, we will do the same - RSP will be a data stack.  Well, let the stack of returns be RBP, which also, by default, works with the stack segment.  Thus, we will have three memory segments: a code segment, a data segment and a stack segment (it will contain both a data stack and a stack of returns). <br><br><h4>  Registers </h4><br>  I go into the description of the registers x86-64, and oops!  There are as many as 8 additional general-purpose registers (R8 - R16) compared to 32 or 16 bit modes. Not bad ... <br><br>  Already decided that they will need RSP and RBP.  You also need a pointer (counter) bytecode commands.  From operations on this register only reading of memory is necessary.  The main registers (RAX, RBX, RCX, RDX, RSI, RDI) are more flexible, universal, there are many special commands with them.  They will be useful to us for various tasks, and for the bytecode command counter we take one of the new registers for me, let it be R8. <br><br><h2>  Let's start? </h2><br>  I have no programming experience on Linux in assembler.  Therefore, to begin with, we will find the ready “Hello, world” to understand how the program starts and displays the text.  Unexpectedly for me, I found variants with a strange syntax, where even the source and receiver are swapped.  As it turned out, this is AT &amp; T syntax, and it is mainly written for Linux on it.  But, another variant of syntax is also supported, it is called Intel-syntax.  Thinking, I decided to use it all the same.  Well, we write in the beginning .intel_syntax noprefix. <br><br>  Compile and execute “Hello, world” to make sure everything works.  By reading the help and experiments, I began to use the following command to compile: <br> <code>$ as fort.asm -o fort.o -g -ahlsm &gt;list.txt</code> <br>  Here, the -o switch specifies the result file, the -g switch instructs to generate debugging information, and the -ahlsm switch specifies the listing format.  And the output is saved in the listing, you can see a lot of useful information in it.  I admit, at the beginning of work I did not make a listing, and did not even specify the -g option.  I began to use the -g switch after the first use of the debugger, and I started to make the listing after the macros appeared in the code :) <br><br>  After that we use the linker, but there is nowhere easier: <br><br> <code>$ ld forth.o -o forth</code> <br>  Well, run! <br> <code>$ ./forth <br> Hello, world!</code> <br>  Works. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">That was such a first forth.asm (actually it is 'Hellow, world!', Of course)</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">.intel_syntax noprefix .section .data msg: .ascii <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"Hello, world!\n"</span></span> len = . - msg # символу len присваивается длина строки .section .text .global _start # точка входа в программу _start: mov eax, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">4</span></span> # системный вызов № <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">4</span></span> — sys_write mov ebx, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> # поток № <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> — <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">stdout</span></span> mov ecx, OFFSET FLAT:msg # указатель на выводимую строку mov edx, len # длина строки <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">int</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x80</span></span> # вызов ядра mov eax, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> # системный вызов № <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> — sys_exit xor ebx, ebx # выход с кодом <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">int</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x80</span></span> # вызов ядра</code> </pre> <br>  By the way, a little later I learned that in x86-64, it is more correct to use syscall for the system call, and not int 0x80.  The 0x80 call is considered obsolete for this architecture, although it is supported. <br></div></div><br>  A start, and now ... <br><br><h2>  Go! </h2><br>  What would have been at least some specifics, we write the code of one byte-command.  Let it be the Fortov word "0", putting 0 on the top of the stack: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">bcmd_num0: push <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span> jmp _next</code> </pre><br>  At the time of execution of this command, R8 already points to the next byte command.  It is necessary to read it, increase R8, determine the executable address from the byte-command code, and transfer control to it. <br><br>  But ... what is the bitness of the address table of byte commands?  Here I had to dig a little in the new for me x86-64 command system.  Alas, I did not find the commands that allow you to go on the shift in memory.  This means either to calculate the address, or the address will be ready - 64 bits.  We have no time to calculate, it means - 64 bits.  In this case, the size of the table will be 256 * 8 = 4096 bytes.  Well, finally encode the _next call: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">_next: movzx rcx, byte ptr [r8] inc r8 jmp [bcmd + rcx*<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">8</span></span>] <span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta"># bcmd - таблица адресов байт-команд</span></span></code> </pre><br>  Not bad, it seems to me ... Only three processor commands, when moving from one byte-command to another. <br><br>  Actually, these commands were not so easy for me.  I had to dig in the command system 0x86-64 again and find the new MOVZX command for me.  In fact, this command converts a size of 8, 16, or 32 bits into a 64-bit register.  There are two variants of this command: unsigned, where the most significant digits are padded with zeros, and the sign bit is MOVSX.  In the sign version, the sign expands, that is, for positive numbers, zeros will go to the upper digits, and for negative numbers - ones.  This option is still useful to us for the lit byte command. <br><br>  By the way, is this option the fastest?  Maybe someone will offer even faster? <br><br>  Well, we now have a byte-machine that can run in a sequence of byte commands and execute them.  We must try it out in business, make it execute at least one command.  But what?  Zero to stack?  But here you don’t even know the result, if you don’t watch the stack under the debugger ... But if the program started, you can complete it :) <br><br>  Let's write the bye command, which completes the execution of the program and writes about it, especially since we have “Hellow, world!”. <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">bcmd_bye: mov eax, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">4</span></span> # системный вызов № <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">4</span></span> — sys_write mov ebx, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> # поток № <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> — <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">stdout</span></span> mov ecx, offset msg_bye # указатель на выводимую строку mov edx, msg_bye_len # длина строки <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">int</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x80</span></span> # вызов ядра mov eax, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> # системный вызов № <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> — sys_exit mov ebx, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span> # выход с кодом <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">int</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x80</span></span> # вызов ядра</code> </pre><br>  It remains to be easy - to create a table of addresses of byte commands, initialize registers, and start the byte machine.  So ... in the table 256 values, and two teams.  What is in the remaining cells? <br>  The rest will have an invalid opcode.  But, it is impossible to do a check on it, these are extra commands, we now have three, and with a check it will be five.  So, we make such a stub command - a bad command.  First we fill the entire table with it, and then we start to occupy the cells with useful commands.  Let the bad command have the code 0x00, the bye command will have 0x01, and the '0' will have the code 0x02, since it has already been written.  A bad team will still do the same thing as bye, only with a different completion code and text (I’ll put in the spoiler, almost the same as bye): <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">bcmd_bad</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">bcmd_bad: mov eax, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">4</span></span> # системный вызов № <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">4</span></span> — sys_write mov ebx, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> # поток № <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> — <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">stdout</span></span> mov ecx, offset msg_bad_byte # указатель на выводимую строку mov edx, msg_bad_byte_len # длина строки <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">int</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x80</span></span> # вызов ядра mov eax, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> # системный вызов № <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> — sys_exit mov ebx, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> # выход с кодом <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">int</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x80</span></span> # вызов ядра</code> </pre> </div></div>  Now draw a table of addresses.

And if not, the result is likely to be: <br><br> <code>$ ./forth <br> Ошибка сегментирования <br></code> <br>  Of course, other options are possible, but I came across this most often.  And we need a debugger. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Lyrical digression about debugger</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  As already mentioned, I used GDB.  This is a pretty powerful debugger, but with a command line interface.  Running it is very simple: <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">$ gdb ./forth GNU gdb (Ubuntu 7.11.1-0ubuntu1~16.5) 7.11.1 Copyright (C) 2016 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

Type "apropos word" to search for commands related to "word"... Reading symbols from ./forth...done. (gdb)</code> </pre> <br>  Further, entering commands, we make debugging.  It took me an hour to find a few necessary commands and learn how to use them for debugging.  Here they are: <br>  b &lt;mark&gt; - put a breakpoint <br>  l &lt;tag&gt; - view source code <br>  r - start or restart of the program <br>  ir - see the state of the processor registers <br>  s - step <br><br>  By the way, remember that you need to compile the program with the -g key?  Otherwise, tags and source code will not be available.  In this case, it will be possible to debug only the disassembled code and use the addresses in memory.  We are, of course, Indians, but not to the same degree ... </div></div><br>  But somehow the program does very little.  We tell her only "Hello", and she immediately "Bye!".  Let's do the real “Hello, world!” Bytecode.  To do this, put on the stack the address and length of the string, then execute the command that outputs the string, and after the bye command.  To do all this, you need new commands: type to display the string, and lit to put the address and length of the string.  In the beginning we will write type, let its code be 0x80.  We, again, need that piece of code with the sys_write call: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">b_type = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x80</span></span> bcmd_type: mov eax, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">4</span></span> # системный вызов № <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">4</span></span> — sys_write mov ebx, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> # поток № <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> — <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">stdout</span></span> pop rdx pop rcx push r8 <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">int</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x80</span></span> # вызов ядра pop r8 jmp _next</code> </pre><br>  Here we take the address and length of the string from the data stack by the POP commands.  The call int 0x80 can change the register of R8, therefore we save it.  Previously, we did not do that, because the program was completed.  The contents of these registers did not care.  Now this is a normal byte command, after which the execution of the byte code continues, and we must behave well. <br><br>  Now we will write the command lit.  This will be our first command with parameters.  After the byte with the code of this command, there will be bytes containing the number that it will put on the stack.  Immediately the question arises - what kind of bit is needed here?  To be able to put any number, you need 64 bits.  But, each time the command will occupy 9 bytes, what would put one number?  So we lose compactness, one of the main properties of the byte-code, and the Fort code, too ... <br><br>  The solution is simple - we will make several commands for different digits.  These will be lit8, lit16, lit32 and lit64.  For small numbers we will use lit8 and lit16, for the big ones - lit32 and lit64.  Small numbers are most often used, and for them there will be the shortest command that occupies two bytes.  Not bad! .. The codes for these commands will be 0x08 - 0x0B. <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">b_lit8 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x08</span></span> bcmd_lit8: movsx rax, byte ptr [r8] inc r8 push rax jmp _next b_lit16 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x09</span></span> bcmd_lit16: movsx rax, word ptr [r8] add r8, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">2</span></span> push rax jmp _next b_lit32 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x0A</span></span> bcmd_lit32: movsx rax, dword ptr [r8] add r8, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">4</span></span> push rax jmp _next b_lit64 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x0B</span></span> bcmd_lit64: mov rax, [r8] add r8, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">8</span></span> push rax jmp _next</code> </pre> <br>  Here we use the MOVSX command - this is a symbolic version of the MOVZX command already known to us.  R8 we have a byte-command counter.  We load on it the value of the desired size, move it to the next command, and convert the value converted to 64 bits to the stack. <br><br>  <b>Do not forget to put the address of the new teams in the table on the desired position.</b> <br><br>  That's all ready to write your first program “Hello, world!” On our bytecode.  Let's work as the compiler!  :) <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">start: .byte b_lit64 .quad msg_hello .byte b_lit8 .byte msg_hello_len .byte b_type .byte b_bye</code> </pre> <br>  We use two different lit commands: lit64 to put the address of the line on the stack, and lit8, with which we push the length onto the stack.  Then we execute two more byte commands: type and bye. <br>  Compile, run: <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">$ as fort.asm -o fort.o -g -ahlsm &gt;list.txt $ ld forth.o -o forth $ ./forth Hello, world! bye!</code> </pre><br>  Earn our bytecode!

You can, everything is in our hands!  We will draw this line in a loop, 10 times.  This will require a conditional branch command, as well as some stack arithmetic: a command decreasing the value on the stack by 1 (on the fort “1-”) and a duplicate vertex command (“dup”). <br><br>  Everything is simple with arithmetic, I will not even comment: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">b_dup = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x18</span></span> bcmd_dup: push [rsp] jmp _next b_wm = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x20</span></span> bcmd_wm: decq [rsp] jmp _next</code> </pre> <br>  Now conditional transition.  To begin with, we will make the task easier - an unconditional transition.  It is clear that you just need to change the value of the register R8.  The first thing that comes to mind is that it will be a byte-command, followed by a parameter — the 64-bit transition address.  Again nine bytes.  Do we need these nine bytes?  Transitions usually occur over short distances, often within a few hundred bytes.  So, we will not use the address, but the offset! <br><br>  Digit capacity?  In many cases, 8 bits (127 forward / backward) will suffice, but sometimes this will not be enough.  Therefore, we will act in the same way as with the lit command, we will make two options - 8 and 16 bits, the command codes will be 0x10 and 0x11: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">b_branch8 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x10</span></span> bcmd_branch8: movsx rax, byte ptr [r8] add r8, rax jmp _next b_branch16 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x11</span></span> bcmd_branch16: movsx rax, word ptr [r8] add r8, rax jmp _next</code> </pre>  Now the conditional transition is quite simple to implement.  If on stack 0, go to _next, and if not, go to the branch command! <br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">b_qbranch8 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x12</span></span> bcmd_qbranch8: pop rax <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">or</span></span> rax, rax jnz bcmd_branch8 inc r8 jmp _next b_qbranch16 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x13</span></span> bcmd_qbranch16: pop rax <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">or</span></span> rax, rax jnz bcmd_branch16 add r8, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">2</span></span> jmp _next</code> </pre> Теперь у нас есть все, что бы сделать цикл: <pre> <code class="cpp hljs">start: .byte b_lit8 .byte <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">10</span></span> #счетчик повторений #тело цикла m0: .byte b_lit64 .quad msg_hello .byte b_lit8 .byte msg_hello_len .byte b_type .byte b_wm .byte b_dup .byte b_qbranch8 .byte m0 - . .byte b_bye</code> </pre> <br> Первые две команды — кладем на стек счетчик цикла.

Мы не можем вызвать из одного байт-кода другой. У нас нет того, что называют подпрограммами, процедурами, и т.д. А в форте без этого мы не сможем использовать в одних словах другие, отличные от слов ядра. <br><br> Доведем работу до конца. Тут впервые нам потребуется стек возвратов. Команды нужны две — команда вызова и команда возврата (call и exit). <br><br> Команда call, в принципе, делает то же самое, что и branch — передает управление на другой кусочек байт-кода. Но, в отличие от branch, нужно еще сохранить адрес возврата в стеке возвратов, что бы можно было вернуться и продолжить выполнение. Есть и еще отличие — такие вызовы могут происходить на гораздо большие расстояния. Поэтому сделаем команду call по подобию branch, но в трех вариантах — 8, 16 и 32 бита. <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">b_call8 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x0C</span></span> bcmd_call8: movsx rax, byte ptr [r8] sub rbp, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">8</span></span> inc r8 mov [rbp], r8 add r8, rax jmp _next b_call16 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x0D</span></span> bcmd_call16: movsx rax, word ptr [r8] sub rbp, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">8</span></span> add r8, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">2</span></span> mov [rbp], r8 add r8, rax jmp _next b_call32 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x0E</span></span> bcmd_call32: movsx rax, dword ptr [r8] sub rbp, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">8</span></span> add r8, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">4</span></span> mov [rbp], r8 add r8, rax jmp _next</code> </pre> <br> Как видим, здесь, в отличие от переходов, добавлены 3 команды. Одна из них переставляет R8 на следующую байт-команду, а оставшиеся две сохраняют полученное значение в стеке возвратов. Кстати, тут я старался не ставить зависимые друг от друга команды процессора рядом, что бы конвеер процессора мог выполнять команды параллельно. Но насколько это дает эффект — не знаю. При желании, потом можно будет проверить на тестах. <br><br> Надо иметь ввиду, что формирование аргумента для команды call несколько отличается, нежели чем для branch. Для branch смещение вычисляется как разница между адресом перехода и адресом байта, следующего за байт-командой. А для команды call это разница между адресом перехода и адресом следующей команды.  Why do you need it? Так получается меньше команд процессора. <br><br> Теперь команда возврата. Собственно, ее дело лишь восстановить R8 из стека возвратов и передать дальше управление байт-машине: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">b_exit = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x1F</span></span> bcmd_exit: mov r8, [rbp] add rbp, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">8</span></span> jmp _next</code> </pre> <br> Эти команды будут применяться очень часто, и оптимизировать их нужно по максимуму. Байт-команда exit занимает три машинных команды. Можно ли тут что-то сократить? Оказывается, можно! Можно просто убрать команду перехода :) <br><br> Для этого разместим ее над точкой входа байт-машины _next: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">b_exit = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x1F</span></span> bcmd_exit: mov r8, [rbp] add rbp, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">8</span></span> _next: movzx rcx, byte ptr [r8] inc r8 jmp [bcmd + rcx*<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">8</span></span>]</code> </pre> <br> Кстати, наиболее важные и часто используемые команды (например, такие как call) нужно разместить ближе к байт-машине, что бы компилятор мог сформировать команду короткого перехода. Это хорошо видно в листинге. Вот пример. <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs"> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">262</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0084</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">490F</span></span>BE00 bcmd_lit8: movsx rax, byte ptr [r8] <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">263</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0088</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">49F</span></span>FC0 inc r8 <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">264</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">008b</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">50</span></span> push rax <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">265</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">008</span></span>c EB90 jmp _next <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">266</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">267</span></span> b_lit16 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x09</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">268</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">008</span></span>e <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">490F</span></span>BF00 bcmd_lit16: movsx rax, word ptr [r8] <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">269</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0092</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">4983</span></span>C002 add r8, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">2</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">270</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0096</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">50</span></span> push rax <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">271</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0097</span></span> EB85 jmp _next <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">272</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">273</span></span> b_lit32 = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x0A</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">274</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0099</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">496300</span></span> bcmd_lit32: movsx rax, dword ptr [r8] <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">275</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">009</span></span>c <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">4983</span></span>C004 add r8, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">4</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">276</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">00</span></span>a0 <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">50</span></span> push rax <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">277</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">00</span></span>a1 E978FFFF jmp _next <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">277</span></span> FF <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">278</span></span></code> </pre> <br> Тут в строке 265 и 271 команда jmp занимает по 2 байта, а в строке 277 та же команда компилируется уже в 5 байт, так как расстояние перехода превысило возможное для короткой команды. <br><br> Поэтому байт-команды, такие, как bad, bye, type переставим дальше, а такие, как call, branch, lit — ближе. К сожалению, в переход 127 байт уместить можно не так много. <br> Новые команды добавим в таблицу адресов команд, согласно их кодам. <br><br> Итак, у нас теперь есть вызов и возврат, протестируем их! Для этого печать строки выделим в отдельную процедуру, и будем вызывать ее в цикле дважды. А число повторений цикла уменьшим до трех. <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">start: .byte b_lit8 .byte <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">3</span></span> #счетчик повторений #тело цикла m0: .byte b_call16 .word sub_hello - . - <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">2</span></span> .byte b_call16 .word sub_hello - . - <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">2</span></span> .byte b_wm .byte b_dup .byte b_qbranch8 .byte m0 - . .byte b_bye sub_hello: .byte b_lit64 .quad msg_hello .byte b_lit8 .byte msg_hello_len .byte b_type .byte b_exit</code> </pre><br> Тут можно было использовать и call8, но я решил применить call16, как наиболее вероятно используемую. Значение 2 вычитается из-за особенности вычисления адреса для байт-команды call, о которой я писал. Для call8 тут будет вычитаться 1, для call32, соответственно, 4. <br> Компилируем и вызываем: <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">$ as forth.asm -o forth.o -g -ahlsm&gt;list.txt $ ld forth.o -o forth $ ./forth Hello, world! Bad byte code!</code> </pre><br> Упс… как говориться, что-то пошло не так :) Ну что ж, запускаем GDB и смотрим что там твориться. Точку останова я поставил сразу на bcmd_exit, так как видно, что вызов sub_hello проходит, и тело процедуры исполняется… запустил… и в точку останова программа не попала. Сразу возникло подозрение на код байт-команды. И, действительно, причина была в нем. b_exit я присвоил значение 0x1f, а сам адрес разместил в ячейке таблицы номер 0x17. Ну что же, исправлю значение b_exit на 0x17 и пробуем снова выполнить: <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">$ as forth.asm -o forth.o -g -ahlsm&gt;list.txt $ ld forth.o -o forth $ ./forth Hello, world!

По скорости, возможно, эта байт-машина будет одной из самых быстрых в своем классе (стековая байт-машина без JIT). Она умеет выполнять команды последовательно, делать условные и безусловные переходы, вызывать процедуры, возвращаться из них. В то же время используемый байт-код обладает достаточной компактностью. В основном, байт-команды занимают 1-3 байта, больше — это очень редко (только числа большого размера, и очень дальние вызовы процедур). Так же набросан небольшой набор байт-команд, который легко расширять. Допустим, все основные команды работы со стеком (drop, swap, over, root и т.д. можно написать минут за 20, столько же уйдет на арифметические целочисленные команды). <br><br> Еще важный момент. Байт-код, в отличие от классического прямого шитого кода форта, не содержит машинных команд, поэтому он может переноситься без перекомпиляции на другую платформу. Достаточно один раз переписать ядро на систему команд нового процессора, и сделать это можно весьма быстро. <br><br> Текущий вариант байт-машины не специфичен для какого-то конкретного языка. Но я хочу сделать на ней реализацию языка Форт потому, что у меня есть опыт работы с ним, и компилятор для него можно сделать очень быстро. <br><br> Если есть к этому интерес, на основе этой машины, в следующей статье, я сделаю ввод-вывод строк и чисел, форт-словарь, и интерпретатор. Можно будет «потрогать» команды руками. Ну а в третей статье сделаем компилятор, и получиться почти законченная форт-система. Затем можно будет написать и скомпилировать какие-либо стандартные алгоритмы и сравнить быстродействие с другими языками и системами. Можно использовать, например, решето Эратосфена, и подобные. <br><br> Интересно еще по экспериментировать с вариантами. Например, сделать таблицу команд 16-ти разрядной, и посмотреть, как это повлияет на быстродействие. Еще можно точку входа _next превратить в макрос, в этом случае машинный код каждой байт-команды увеличиться в размере на две команды (минус переход и плюс три команды из _next). То есть, в конце будет не переход на _next, а содержимое самой точки _next (это 14 байт). Интересно узнать, как это повлияет на быстродействие. Еще можно попробовать сделать оптимизацию, используя регистры. Например, стандартный цикл со счетчиком в форте хранит счетчик в стеке возвратов. Можно сделать регистровый вариант и так же по тестировать. <br><br> Еще можно сделать компилятор выражений, записанных в классической форме (например, A = 5 + (B + C * 4) ). <br><br> В общем, есть простор для экспериментов!  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/431932/">https://habr.com/ru/post/431932/</a></p>
