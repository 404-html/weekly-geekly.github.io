  <section class="page js-page"><h1>JS 2018 results and forecasts for the future</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello! <br><br>  At the end of the year, I decided to think what awaits the JS developer in the New 2019 and take stock of this year. <br><br>  Welcome under the cut! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For a start, I propose to recall what happened this year in the world of Javascript. <br><br>  First of all, I would like to highlight the release of Ecmascript 2018 ( <a href="https://medium.com/%40linus2228/javascript-%25D1%2587%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25B2-ecmascript-2018-es2018-e0af4a53cb5c">article on the medium in Russian</a> ). <br><br>  It added a lot of cool stuff, I want to highlight rest / spread and support for asynchronous iterations.  JS is becoming more like a Python, borrowing from him the best features. <br><br>  By the way, about Python.  Everyone knows that it is actively used for data analysis and machine learning.  So, the outgoing 2018 has pleased Javascript developers with the release of <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/numjs">numjs</a> (port of python numpy) and <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs">tensorflowjs</a> . <br><br>  And this is very cool!  I think that in 2019 we will have even more interesting releases related to data analysis on JS. <br><br>  Even this year, we watched the opposition React vs Vue.js. <br><br>  Google trends says that Reactjs searched more often than vuejs: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vh/nf/bt/vhnfbtsfcqnvfhdgw_g5t0dgrwi.png"><br><br>  React developers are more in demand in the labor market: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/462/c20/d11/462c20d11abf618b2c45ee6d339cc8b8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Whether vue will succeed in catching up with the reactance in 2019 only time will tell. <br><br>  Angular, too, should not be written off, because behind it is Google and a lot of sites are written on it.  As a result, all three frameworks are in demand, but the leader is, in my opinion, React. <br><br>  In the world of server-side JS, there have also been changes - first of all, these are nodejs and npm releases, of course.  The most interesting, in my opinion, are the release of Node 10 and with it NPM6 <br>  (here is the <a href="https://habr.com/post/354234/">article</a> ).  N-API stabilization and improved support for new features is great! <br><br>  This year, Typescript finally hit the TOP100 in the TIOBE ranking.  I think in the coming year his popularity will continue to grow. <br><br>  I would also like to mention the release of Webpack 4 and beta of Webpack 5, support for Typescript in create-react-app from version 2 and release of electron 3 and 4. <br><br>  As a result, JS world was actively developing in 2018, new interesting releases came out and I can assume that 2019 will be even more interesting). <br><br>  Happy New Year to all habrovchan! <br><br>  In the new year, write a good code, do not be ill and write good articles on Habr. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/434788/">https://habr.com/ru/post/434788/</a></p>
