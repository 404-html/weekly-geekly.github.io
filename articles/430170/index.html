The court ruled on the basis of a statement from Springer Nature. <br><br>  About blocking, the founder of Sci-Hub, Alexandra Elbakyan, reported.  The court definition can be found <a href="https://www.mos-gorsud.ru/mgs/defend/statementForm/71b331ec-39df-458f-b19e-8d91eeb72815">by reference</a> in the file of Moscow courts of general jurisdiction. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Springer Nature initially applied for provisional interim measures to protect copyright or related rights for three scientific articles that were published in Nature Reviews Cardiology and Nature Reviews Neuroscience in January-March 2018.  The court ruled that the application must be satisfied by obliging Roskomnadzor to ‚Äústop creating technical conditions ensuring the placement, distribution and other use of works‚Äù, which are indicated in the application.  The main version of the Sci-Hub portal and several of its mirrors turned out to be blocked. <br><br>  The project is still available at the address that did not make the list.  Among other things, the court established a period of 15 days.  During this time, Springer Nature may apply.  The file indicates that the application was submitted on October 31.  On November 23, a conversation was scheduled on this case. <br><br>  In May of this year, <a href="https://habr.com/post/374475/">it was reported</a> that Sci-Hub domain certificates were revoked by Comodo CA.  It is the largest certification authority in the world.  The company decided not to do it of its own accord, it followed the court order.  "Comodo CA is obliged to act in accordance with court decisions and in accordance with the law," - said the representative of Comodo.  In total, four safety certificates were withdrawn. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/430170/">https://habr.com/ru/post/430170/</a></p>
