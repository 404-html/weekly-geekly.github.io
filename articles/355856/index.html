  <section class="page js-page"><h1>And then they let out</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, there have been many complaints about speed on the Internet.  The reason, unfortunately, is simple.  Some people do not respect others and single-handedly treacherously utilize the entire channel for personal use.  It is necessary to legally limit the speed of the Internet from above 13 Mbit / s.  This is more than enough for absolutely all needs.  And if some suspicious individuals express fears that such a restriction prevents them, then questions will arise. <br><br>  The modern citizen is not able to focus on any business, the reasons for this are many.  One of them is the distribution of social networks, Internet mailboxes, instant messengers.  A good solution would be to limit the number of accounts to six.  The fact is that a rare person can hold more than 6 objects in his head and not experience stress.  Accounting, that is, registration in various services, it is proposed to carry out through public services. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The introduction of Christianity as the state religion in Ancient Russia, implemented at the end of the 10th century by Prince Vladimir Svyatoslavich, is an excellent example for establishing a single programming language in Russia.  The fragmentation and confrontation between supporters of different directions in programming hinders the development of the information technology sector.  A single programming language will be the stage that will lift our country above other countries. <br><br>  The Internet curator is a new position, which should appear in every district of the city.  This person will be responsible for his sector and report to a higher curator.  Responsibilities will include monitoring downloaded on the Internet, for the confrontation of prohibited extremist materials. <br><br>  Mandatory webinars with heads of regions will become an integral part of the school curriculum.  Every quarter, 1 academic hour, the head of the region will tell students about the current state of affairs in the field and plans for the future.  This will help foster a sense of responsibility and patriotism.  In addition, it will give students the opportunity to recognize in the face of those who help them learn.  For religious education, the Word of the Shepherd should be added to the curriculum, where the clergy will introduce the correct attitude towards religions among the students.  We must not forget about science: at least 2 academic hours per year, the doctor of physical and mathematical sciences will tell students about the latest achievements and breakthroughs in modern materials science. <br><br>  As an incentive to increase literacy and loyalty to the Russian language, it is necessary to automatically check the children‚Äôs written in social networks and the emails sent by them and notify parents of grammatical errors made by children. <br><br>  And the last.  Graduates of information technology universities should be mandatory in the Russian state-funded projects.  The minimum required to protect a diploma is 200 lines of code. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/355856/">https://habr.com/ru/post/355856/</a></p>
