The study was based on 671 million push-messages and more than 1.4 billion events within applications, the results of which made it clear that 63% of marketers from all over the world are not able to find the right frequency, message sending and sending time in applications. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Application marketers in North America underestimate how they interact with users in the evening.  At the same time, users on the contrary pay more attention to the messages received. <br><br>  Often, marketers send outdated content to push messages and do not take into account the read information by users when opening applications. <br><br>  Many of the marketers do not take into account the time zone of users - sometimes notifications come in the nights when most of them are sleeping.  Basically, the emphasis is on time during the daytime for residents of North America. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúIn fact, everything is simple.  There is a gap in personalization for users.  Most of the modern methods are based on outdated techniques built on the basis of marketing, intended for mailing lists or other approaches from websites. <br><br>  Mobile marketing must be personalized.  In those moments when marketers do not use the personalization of their solutions: they do not take into account the time of sending messages, the behavior of users based on triggers.  They miss the whole point of mobile advertising. <br><br>  According to our data, push messages are one of the most effective ways to interact with users, ‚Äùsaid Momchil Kukrichev, CEO of Leanplum, to <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2016/03/01/analysis-of-671m-push-notifications-shows-mobile-marketings-potential-has-barely-been-tapped/">Venture Beat</a> . </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/afc/855/a2f/afc855a2fb7c49ad9c00fb23e9ed2ac0.png"><br><br>  As part of the research among companies from the Fortune 500, it became clear that in most cases the mobile application team is divorced from the company's internal processes.  This leads to a lack of synchronization between them and a lack of understanding of basic things on the best ways to interact with users.  In order for advertising in mobile applications to be effective - you need to properly adapt to the user, personalizing all the content provided.  Ultimately, all applications will eventually follow this example. <br><br>  All this is also influenced by the speed of market development, which requires rapid integration with new services, and only marketers cannot be blamed on this issue.  We need a comprehensive approach to the issue of advertising in mobile applications. <br><br>  The next step in mobile marketing will be user segmentation based on their preferences within applications.  This includes consideration of interests, activities or time of use.  Such personalization will allow to deliver those messages that are most relevant to the user at a particular point in time, which will increase the likelihood of interaction with them, without causing negative emotions.  Moreover, the approach with individual notifications is always more advantageous than sending notifications on a simple schedule without taking into account the interests of users. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299032/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299032/</a></p>
