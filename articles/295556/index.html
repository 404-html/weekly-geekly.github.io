  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Megaphone strikes Tele2 on Tele2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  MegaFon subscribers in all cities of Russia are waiting for a change.  From November 9, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25A4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">MegaFon</a> will no longer take into account the ‚ÄúAll Inclusive‚Äù tariff plans (there are five of them) so-called on-net calls.  Minutes of conversation, for which a fixed fee is charged, will now consist only of calls to numbers of other operators.  Inside the network you can call without restrictions, said the representative of the company "Megaphone" Julia Dorokhina. <br><br>  According to her, about 25% of the Russian subscribers of MegaFon use the tariffs of the ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù line.  Approximately 60% of their calls are intranet. <br><br>  The operator makes such a gift for subscribers for a reason.  Probably, Megafon specifically announced innovations on the eve of the entry of Tele2 operator to the capital market. <a name="habracut"></a>  "Megamind" wrote that on October 22 Tele2 <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/19320/">starts</a> in Moscow. <br><br>  All operators of the ‚ÄúBig Three‚Äù have long been accustomed to calling intranet calls free, but this is not quite accurate, the Vedomosti correspondents <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2015/10/20/613491-megafon-podgotovilsya-vstreche-tele2">found out</a> . <br><br>  The package offers of operators often include on-net calls.  Thus, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D1%258B%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB-%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">VimpelCom</a> ‚Äôs ‚ÄúEverything‚Äù line (six tariff plans) only in the most economical option - 200 rubles per month - does not include on-net calls.  In the rest, they are indirectly charged, although these packages include so many services that more than cover the needs of subscribers for calls to any numbers, recognizes the representative of VimpelCom, Anna Aybasheva.  Vimpelcom has about 30% of Russian subscribers of the package, she said.  According to data for 2013, in Moscow, VimpelCom received about 40% of its revenue throughout Russia. <br><br>  In <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D1%258B">MTS,</a> in the cheapest version of the Smart tariff line, on-net calls in the home region are beyond the limits, and in the rest - taken into account, follows from the information on the site.  Intranet calls over the limit are completely free, Aybasheva and Solodovnikov point out. <br><br>  Tele2 will not disclose Moscow tariffs until October 21.  They differ from region to region, says Tele2 spokesman Konstantin Prokshin: for example, in St. Petersburg, on-net calls consume minutes from the package, but this does not mean that Moscow will have the same number of Muscovites waiting for some innovations. <br><br>  The manager of one of the Big Three companies spoke about the scheme for Tele2 to enter new cities: first, the operator sets tariffs 20‚Äì50% lower than the market, and as the market share increases, it reduces the discount. <br><br>  In addition to free on-net calls, MegaFon is increasing its Internet traffic packages.  In particular, on the most popular line rate - ‚ÄúAll inclusive M‚Äù, the size of available Internet traffic will grow from 4 to 5 gigabytes, which can now be spent on traveling around Russia. <br><br>  The actions of MegaFon are logical precisely on the eve of the fourth player entering the market, the source of Vedomosti acknowledges.  If, for example, the subscriber decides to switch from MegaFon to Tele2, his relatives and friends will also have to do this.  Otherwise, metropolitan Tele2 customers will have to mainly call the numbers of the Big Three operators.  Thus, Tele2 will be deprived of the advantage of a large subscriber base, which allows customers to communicate for free within the network. <br><br>  Now all the marketing activities of the ‚Äúbig three‚Äù are somehow connected with entering the Moscow market of Tele2, ik <a href="http://www.iksconsulting.ru/">-Consulting</a> analyst Maxim Savvatin is sure.  But in the future, they are unlikely to be very dumping: they have a strong position in the market, and Tele2 will need time to press them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295556/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295556/</a></p>
