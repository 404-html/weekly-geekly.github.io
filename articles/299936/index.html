Such is the nature of entrepreneurship.  To survive, many young companies are trying to do as much as possible, spending as little resources as possible.  And often, this means that one person does the work of many. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Despite such efforts, success may not come. <br>  Studies show that 15% of small enterprises are closed after one year of work, another 50% do not stand on the market even five years.  Of course, this is due to many reasons, but the lack of specialists due to their high cost is one of the main reasons. <br><br>  Use these three tips that do not require any costs, but slightly simplify business life: <br><br>  <b>1. Surround yourself with people like you.</b> <br><br>  The easiest way to get free advice and even advice.  This, of course, will not save you from the eternal running around from one business to another and will not add a new specialist to your staff.  However, it will allow business owners to share their specific skills, experience with colleagues who face similar problems. <br>  Understanding the importance of communication with colleagues and like-minded people, we created a corporate chat for all franchisees, where young (and not so) entrepreneurs can share their experience with each other and ask questions to us and our specialists. <br><br>  <b>2. Gather a board of directors you can trust</b> <br><br>  The board of directors may seem like a silly undertaking for a small company, but, given the potential breadth of knowledge, it will bring tangible benefits and development to the business.  It is never too early to gather a group of business partners who can invest small amounts of money, energy or knowledge in your common cause. <br><br>  <b>3. Let programs do the hard work for you</b> <br><br>  Small business owners may not be able to afford a financial director, and sometimes an accountant.  But maybe these people are not needed for now? <br>  With the help of modern programs, you can easily create invoices, contracts and any papers with no special knowledge.  Sometimes, right from a mobile phone, lying on the beach. <br>  There are many services for creating simple but stylish designs, and even websites.  Find or write your own software, which will significantly unload the task list. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299936/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299936/</a></p>
