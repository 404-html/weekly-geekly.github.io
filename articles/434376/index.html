True, this will not be a completely unmanned journey - there will be an operator at the driver‚Äôs place who will monitor the autopilot‚Äôs work. <br><br>  Robomobil will master the roads of Tel Aviv.  So far, it is unclear whether Yandex can test several vehicles at once or it is all about one car.  Israel has been selected for testing because the country's legislation allows testing of robotic vehicles on public roads. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In addition, the country has very different climatic conditions, so this is another opportunity to try out the robility mobile for "durability".  Plus, in Israel, a lot of companies that are engaged in the development of robots.  Yandex may cooperate with some of them.  One such company is Mobileye, it develops vehicle recognition systems without using lidars and radars. <br><br>  In addition, this month Yandex launched its own taxi service in Israel.  Perhaps the company will invite passengers to ride on cars with robotic controls. <br><br>  In October, <a href="https://habr.com/post/426589/">it was reported</a> that the unmanned taxi "Yandex" began work on the territory of Skolkovo.  They decided to divide the project into several stages.  The first allows the use of machines with an unmanned system only for residents of the innovation center.  Further, the range of passengers will be expanded, but this is only subject to the successful completion of the first testing phase. <br><br>  Work on the technology for an unmanned vehicle has been underway since 2016, it uses various ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù developments from areas such as machine learning, computer vision and navigation.  In June 2017, the company conducted a closed unmanned vehicle test.  Then, two prototypes took part in the test, each of which had sensors and specialized software installed.  Sensors collect information about the condition of the vehicle and the environment, and specialized software determines how the machine should move after analyzing the information received from the sensors. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/434376/">https://habr.com/ru/post/434376/</a></p>
