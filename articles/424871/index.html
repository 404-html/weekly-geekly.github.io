  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ilon Musk and Tesla settle legal disputes with the US Securities and Exchange Commission</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Tesla founder Ilon Mask agreed to pay a fine of $ 20 million and leave the post of chairman of the board of directors as part of the settlement of the claim of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Tesla will also pay an additional $ 20 million in fines and will agree to add two independent directors to its board, writes The Washington Post. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/18/nn/v-/18nnv-v6zlfs-udn00ivu0m6fxu.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>In the continuation of <a href="https://habr.com/post/424685/">this post</a> .</i> <br><br>  Mask will leave the board of directors within 45 days and will be removed from this position within three years.  However, he will retain the post of CEO of the company and is not obliged to admit guilt. <br><br>  Musk committed this act 48 hours before the time in the lawsuit that threatened to plunge Tesla into unprecedented chaos. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe legal protections and assistance applied today are specifically designed to solve problems related to Ilona Mask‚Äôs misconduct by strengthening corporate governance and oversight of Tesla in the interests of investors,‚Äù said Stephanie Avagian, a representative of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. <br><br>  Tesla declined to comment on this settlement. <br><br>  Responding to the SEC lawsuit at the beginning of the week, Musk said that the ‚Äúunjustified action‚Äù of the SEC ‚Äúleft him deeply saddened and disappointed.‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúHonesty is what I value most in my life, and the facts will show that I have never compromised anyone,‚Äù he added. <br><br>  The Mask, Tesla and SEC deal, announced on Saturday, was even more surprising because the SEC offered similar conditions last week after an investigation, which was unusually fast. <br><br>  Musk harshly rejected the original settlement proposal for this deal with the SEC earlier this week. <br><br>  Meanwhile, Musk hired several high-ranking lawyers to prepare for the defense of Tesla and fight for his career. <br><br>  But Tesla's shares fell more than 14 percent after the SEC lawsuit, reflecting the degree of risk associated with management. <br><br>  It is unclear why Musk, who rarely retreats from battle, changed his mind. <br><br>  Tesla's lawyer (Bradley Bondi from Cahill Gordon &amp; Reindel) and Mask's lawyer (Stephen Farina from Williams &amp; Connolly) made several night calls to the SEC, trying to resolve this issue, according to a person close to the company but not authorized to talk about it . <br><br>  The capitulation was ‚Äúprobably caused by pressure from investors,‚Äù says Michelle Krebs, an executive analyst at Autotrader.  Given the potential punishments they faced, if it came to court, "Mask and Tesla were lucky. ... However, reckless tweet cost a lot of money - the 20 millionth tweet." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/424871/">https://habr.com/ru/post/424871/</a></p>
