Then it was said that the company needs to think about what the second generation of smart glasses will be, taking into account the mistakes and shortcomings of the first generation. <br><br>  However, after this announcement, many decided that the project was closed not for a while, but forever.  Apparently, this is still not the case - the company is <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/02/new-google-glass-boss-to-reset-project-start-over-from-scratch/">going to carry out further work</a> on the project.  That's just the head of the project is now Tony Fadell, and the new boss is going to start the project from scratch. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Perhaps, just Tony will succeed - after all, he previously worked at Apple, Fadella is called the ‚Äúfather of the iPod‚Äù, and then he left to create a new company that was developing the smart thermostat Nest.  In general, Fadell has both abilities and vast experience - maybe this is the person who needs Google Glass to breathe a second life into the project. <br><br>  Tony himself has already said that he wants to start everything from scratch.  Perhaps the previous version of Google Glass will have to forget, and indeed, start development from scratch, taking into account all the weak points of the previous generation of smart glasses (and there are a lot of them).  Nevertheless, it is a mistake to expect the appearance of the second generation of glasses in a couple of months - most likely, it will take many months, if not years, to create a new version.  On the other hand, if the project is delayed in time, then Google Glass can definitely be forgiven - too many competitors, and very worthy ones, appear. <br><br>  Now Google has problems not only with Google Glass: something similar is happening with the social network Google+, which will also be redesigned, rethink the concept itself.  So Google has two problems on the horizon that need to be addressed. <br><br>  But, apparently, Google Glass number 2 is not very soon appear on the market, or at least as a version for devovepperaov. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/376217/">https://habr.com/ru/post/376217/</a></p>
