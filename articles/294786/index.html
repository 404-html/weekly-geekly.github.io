In rubles, this amount is approximately 300 million.  The transaction must be closed after a few days.  This was reported by a source close to Otkritie FC, sources close to Rocketbank and <a href="http://intercommerz.ru/">Interkommerts</a> Bank. <br><br>  <i>Source: <a href="https://twitter.com/VictorLys/status/647027877930737664">Viktor Lysenko</a></i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In the opinion of <a href="http://www.frankrg.com/">Frank Research Group</a> CEO Yuri Gribanov, the acquisition of Roketbank is in the logic of Otkritie‚Äôs acquisitions: ‚ÄúThe deal is similar to the one with <a href="https://tochka.com/">the Tochka</a> service and says that Otkritie believes in technology market such services " <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt was difficult for the project to‚Äú take off ‚Äùduring the processing of the Interkommerts Bank, and Otkrytie has more resources, opportunities and political will to develop this service,‚Äù the general director of the Frank Research group believes.  Since it is difficult to raise funds now, one of the options is to sell the project entirely to an institutional investor. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn the event that Rocket finds a buyer among banks, it is obvious that a change in the settlement bank will occur within the project,‚Äù said Gleb Klimentiev from Interkommerts Bank.  For clients of the Roketbank service, a possible change in the settlement bank will take place ‚Äúalmost imperceptibly,‚Äù he added. <br><br>  Negotiations on the sale of Roketbank were also conducted by the Orient Express and <a href="https://www.tinkoff.ru/">Tinkoff</a> banks by Oleg Tinkov, RBC <a href="http://top.rbc.ru/finances/24/09/2015/5603c8839a794731e0ab74cc">reports</a> .  The owner of Tinkoff Bank noted that such a purchase for him was ‚Äúnot at all complimentary.‚Äù  He explained that Tinkoff Bank already has options similar to those offered by Roketbank.  ‚ÄúTherefore, buying a second such product with such a team, part of which will inevitably leave, made no sense,‚Äù he said. <br><br>  On September 9, Megamind <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/19266/">wrote</a> that Oleg Tinkov offered to the founders of Roketbank to sell it for $ 1 million if the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php%3Ffbid%3D1108276725866516%26set%3Da.210650872295777.59972.100000525969697%26type%3D1%26theater">post of an</a> entrepreneur about a possible purchase of this application collects 2,000 likes.  He also warned that on September 15 the amount offered by him would drop to 1 ruble.  The co-founder of the service, Oleg Kozyrev, said then that he considered such a sum to be frivolous. <br><br>  Oleg Tinkov has a special relationship with Roketbank.  One of the founders of Roketbank, waylaid Tinkov on the street and asked what he thought of the new service.  Tinkov replied that the application is beautiful, but there is no bank.  Then a comment with a photo of Tinkov came online.  The negative reaction of the entrepreneur was used for public relations of a competitor.  Rocketbank competes with Tinkoff Bank in the field of online banking. <br><br>  The target audience of the application is young people aged 25‚Äì35 years.  The bank was established by Oleg Kozyrev, Viktor Lysenko, Alexey Kolesnikov and Mikhail Provision.  The Rocketbank project was initially developed with the money of the founders themselves, later they attracted funds from the <a href="http://www.runacap.com/">Runa Capital fund</a> and the <a href="http://life-sreda.ru/">Life.Sreda</a> fund.  Runa Capital invested $ 2-3 million in the Rocketbank project in exchange for a 20‚Äì30% stake. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294786/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294786/</a></p>
