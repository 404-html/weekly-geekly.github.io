  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Impression of the 3rd Innovate or Die Conference</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On November 16, 2017, Moscow hosted the 3rd federal practical conference on corporate innovations, <a href="http://moscow.innovateordie.ru/">Innovate or Die</a> , organized by the <a href="http://disruptive.vc/">IIDF in</a> collaboration with <a href="http://disruptive.vc/">disruptive.vc</a> .  I attended this event and is ready to share already established feelings and conclusions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u7/sm/lx/u7smlxe0d2xbymptwtzze2q-iiu.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Considering that I, as I am sure, most readers do, have no TV at home and have a persistent allergy to slogans sounding from the zombie box about the breakthrough development of our economy through innovations, we need to clarify the use of this term in relation to our case and explain his connection with startups. <br><br>  Innovation, as part of this event, refers to the process of attracting start-ups to a working business, in order to optimize existing processes, develop existing services, or create new businesses (diversification, venture capital financing). <br><br>  So, the conclusions of the event: <br><br>  <b>1. Innovation industry is booming</b> <br><br>  If you still think that innovation - the lot of banks and telecoms - you are mistaken.  Of the 35 speakers, only 3 banks and 4 telecoms were represented.  Large companies of the real sector are being tightened - PJSC Sibur Holding, PJSC Gazprom Neft, Rosatom, Russian Helicopters JSC and others.  Companies with highly competitive markets that traditionally know how to count money are not lagging behind, and sometimes they are leading - PepsiCo Russia, Philip Morris International, GC Novard.  This means that the process is effective and we will see more and more new players. <br><br>  <b>2. Innovations are available to all.</b> <br><br>  The opinion that only large companies can call themselves innovations is wrong.  Now the entry threshold for companies (actually working figures are announced) - from 250 tr.  plus labor costs for the process.  This further expands the number of participants and increases the demand for truly effective ideas. <br>  As for opportunities for startups, the market is now such that, possessing a proven hypothesis (tested daily), it is quite possible to get the first round of financing in the amount from the above 250 thousand to 2 million rubles. <br><br>  <b>3. Innovation is not just about IT</b> <br><br>  I believe that traditional R &amp; D was not consciously considered at the conference - there are other platforms for this.  The existing total dominance of IT innovations can be explained both by the sampling conditions and the rapid development of the IT industry, and by the fact that, at the growth stage, the industry is the first to respond to the emerging demand.  It is also encouraging. <br><br>  <b>4. Not a revolution, but evolution</b> <br><br>  Innovation is a management method and toolkit that allows you to get all the benefits from the spirit of entrepreneurship and rapid change and implement them in a mature business in a timely manner.  Taking into account the constantly increasing speed of technological progress, and the impossibility of maintaining such speed by large organizational structures, the name of the event no longer looks like a prophecy, but as a well-founded forecast. <br><br>  <b>5. Technology maturity and risks</b> <br><br>  All companies whose reports I have been able to listen to use approximately the same technology that reduces risks.  This is following the principles of AGILE in the methodology of Lean startup or another, with maximum customer orientation, development of MVP and preventive testing of user hypotheses.  If you plan to go with your startup to the innovation market - you need to understand these principles and follow them. <br><br>  <b>TOTAL:</b> <br><br>  If you are going to make a technology startup, or you have a good idea, now is the time to start implementing it. <br><br>  Start-up support technologies have been debugged, in these organizations they will help you to shape your idea and will find investors from the list of large companies.  Of course, you need to clearly understand that together with the infusion of money you will receive requirements for their return in the form of a share or a requirement for performing specific tasks and monitoring your activities, and the interest of the intermediary will be taken into account.  This, however, does not exclude that the mediator himself will be ready to act as an investor if the project seems promising to him. <br><br>  At the same time, given the number of companies that already have separate units involved in innovation, you should not get hung up on startup aggregators - you can and should work directly with customers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/342876/">https://habr.com/ru/post/342876/</a></p>
