  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About hybrid intelligence and the unknown Watson (Watson)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many people know how sometimes robotic assistants in various interactive speech services are stupidly stupid, how it infuriates and harms the reputation and progress in automatic speech recognition.  Yesterday I learned about a very simple, but effective technology from the company <a href="http://interactions.net/">Interactions</a> , which allows all this ugliness to significantly smooth out.  I can not say that, in general, I follow the news in this area, but, since the technology is patented and little known, I am ready to assume that the button accordions are not cast aside.  Called <i><a href="http://www.interactions.net/product/adaptive-understanding/">Adaptive-Understanding</a></i> . <br><br>  The idea is painfully obvious in its genius: if the automatic speech handler recognizer does not understand what is required of it, the request is forwarded to a living human operator, who customizes the request to a format understandable to the machine.  The user at the same time all the time communicating with the robot.  Lived: not a robot helps a person, but a person to a robot. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I was also surprised to learn that, as a recognizer-handler, Interactions acquired an engine named Watson with the surname AT &amp; T, that is, in our opinion, AT &amp; T Watson.  And this is not at all IBM Watson, about which everyone has heard.  And the difference is not only in the fact that one is named after the founder of IBM, and the second is named after assistant A. Bell.  Although outside, perhaps, the only difference is this. <br><br>  Representatives of Interactions, with some sadness, claim that the names coincide randomly and try to position their product as having nothing in common with the creation of IBM.  In some ways, of course, they are right.  If IBM, according to legend, conceived its Watson for an intellectual TV game with the indecent name Jeopardy, then <a href="http://www.research.att.com/projects/WATSON/%3Ffbid%3D0cdONSV3PcL">Watson from AT &amp; T</a> was initially more focused on various (not only verbal) user interaction in systems like the Smart House.  And even the unknown Watson's speech recognition engine has its own, competing with that of Nuance. <br><br>  Regarding the coincidence of the names, my colleague recalled Dr. Watson, who helped (I don‚Äôt remember what exactly) Sherlock Holmes, and suggested that the Anglo-Saxon name Watson bears such an assistant shade. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/376473/">https://habr.com/ru/post/376473/</a></p>
