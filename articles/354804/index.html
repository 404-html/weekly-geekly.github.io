  <section class="page js-page"><h1>If online stores were chairs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There are many CMS for online stores in the network, and I often get asked the same question: ‚ÄúWhy did you make another one?‚Äù. <br><br>  The answer for me has always been obvious - just as sincere was the surprise of asking this question.  However, after 6 years, this obviousness led to the fact that I could not quickly formulate a short answer.  Therefore, I fix it on Habr√©, suddenly another cognitive stupor will happen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/019/c6d/262/019c6d262313d6dc42950e561df9991f.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What is Pokupo for? </h4><br>  In the spring of 2012, I ran into a problem.  It was necessary to urgently make an online store.  I looked at the free options for a long time, but once again I was convinced of the relevance of the well-known saying about cheese and mousetrap.  Conventionally, the options could be divided into two groups. <br><br><ol><li>  Money in the morning, evening chairs </li><li>  Conditionally free lumber </li></ol><br>  In the first version, you could only sit on a chair for a short time.  Either sit as long as you like, but the chair is either without a back or on one leg.  And if you want a full chair forever - the money in the studio!  And every month, and regardless of how much you can earn in a chair.  Honestly - infuriated - I need a chair for work, and it is only rented, and you can sit on it only in the specified place! <br><br>  The second option consisted of full-fledged chairs with beautiful packaging, a label and a small ‚ÄúDo it yourself!‚Äù Signature.  That is, it is possible for free, but if you do not have a techie‚Äôs hands, or a techie‚Äôs hands, but they don‚Äôt grow from there or the wrong way, you‚Äôll have money in the studio!  For the collection - once!, For the hosting domain - two!, For technical support (if that falls off - and a 100% guarantee that it falls off) - three! <br><br>  Exit was found quickly, but I went to him for a long and expensive.  We decided with the team to create our own "chair-manufacturing" factory.  Two years and several million rubles have passed, and the Pokupo Trading Platform has appeared. <br><br>  "What is the catch?" - you ask.  It's simple - while you learn, sell only to your surroundings - you do not pay anything.  I understood that it was at this stage that the most difficult thing was, since a lot of money is spent on the purchase of goods, searching for partners, intermediaries, but ... as soon as partners start earning - they share their success.  Believe me, this does not begin with the first profit, but at a stage when you don‚Äôt even notice the percentage paid to the trading floor. <br><br>  Our partners begin to share profits only when they are confidently getting on their feet and really want to pay us remuneration only because during this time we become a reliable business partner, loyal and faithful friend, who is ready to come to the rescue at any time. <br><br>  Returning to the initial question and formulating the answer: "Pokupo was created to help everyone to start a successful business with minimal risk." <br><br>  As it turned out, my ideas were not new, a book has already been written about it, which has become a desktop tool for entrepreneurs of the ‚ÄúDiscovering the Future Organization‚Äù platform.  It doesn‚Äôt mean that Pokupo is an ideal platform, there are both inconveniences and chips, because each of us has our own ideas about comfortable working conditions.  But when you carefully study our advantages, I really hope that you say: ‚ÄúYes, this is exactly what I was looking for!‚Äù <br><br><h4>  What are the main advantages of working with the Pokupo trading platform? <br></h4><br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Pokupo.ru </th><th>  Other platforms and platforms </th></tr><tr><td>  Clients - partners - pay when they earn </td><td>  Customers - consumers - pay regardless </td></tr><tr><td>  Functionality is available without subscription. </td><td>  Free demo version, full functionality for the subscription fee </td></tr><tr><td>  Online store turnkey.  Sales immediately after registration </td><td>  To pay through the site, you need to connect an additional module, often several </td></tr><tr><td>  The profit - the lower the tariff </td><td>  The more profit - the more expensive the package of services must be paid. </td></tr><tr><td>  For each client can be your rate </td><td>  Tariffs cannot be changed </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Now we are going in a direction that will allow us to erase, even if partially, the boundaries between the client, partner and colleague, everyone can participate in the development of the platform and receive remuneration for this, our help.  Our team offers you a powerful tool for sales, business activity and business cooperation. <br><br>  Things are easy - to make the first step towards us. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/354804/">https://habr.com/ru/post/354804/</a></p>
