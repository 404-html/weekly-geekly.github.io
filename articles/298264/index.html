  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Presidential instructions on legalization and support for self-employed citizens are included in the anti-crisis plan</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed to expand support and accounting for self-employed citizens.  Such citizens should be understood as anyone who provides services without registering as an individual entrepreneur.  This category also includes people who rent apartments. <br><br>  The government included this order in the anti-crisis plan.  By February 1, the development of this plan should be completed. <br><br>  According to Kommersant, the list of measures to support self-employed citizens has a new item, implying the introduction of a patent for them and even the possibility of obtaining and paying for such a patent in electronic form. <br><br>  Other measures include the organization of public services for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) on the basis of multifunctional centers (MFC) and the creation of "specialized" MFC for the needs of small and medium enterprises. <a name="habracut"></a>  The government also supports the idea of ​​providing “services on the creation and running of a business” on the basis of the employment services of the population and “engaging socially vulnerable groups in business”.  Organization of such consultations and seminars will be carried out by JSC "Corporation of SMEs" on the basis of infrastructure to support small and medium-sized businesses. <br><br>  Before June 1, the authorities, on the basis of the new order of the president, must make the appropriate changes to the legislation.  The corresponding <a href="http://www.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/51215">document</a> was published on the Kremlin’s website on January 27, Kommersant <a href="http://kommersant.ru/doc/2902532">reports</a> . <br><br>  In addition to these measures, the plan already contains proposals for self-employed citizens: the Ministry of Economy proposed reducing the burden on patent payers (including self-employed), giving them the right to deduct insurance premiums from the patent value.  Now the minimum contribution amount is 22 thousand rubles a year.  According to the ministry, the reluctance to pay this amount keeps potential patent recipients from getting out of the shadows. <br><br>  In the anti-crisis plan of the government about 100 points.  20 of them relate to small and medium-sized businesses in general.  Among them: <br><br>  • an increase in the threshold for applying special tax regimes to 120 million rubles (Now this threshold, which did not change in 2008, is 60 million rubles); <br><br>  • the indefinite extension of the single tax on imputed income (UTII) after January 1, 2018; <br><br>  • introduction of a moratorium on the increase in UTII in 2017 (or rather, an increase in the deflator coefficient for which this tax is calculated); <br><br>  • fixing a uniform standard for the deduction of property tax calculated on the cadastral value (companies owning premises with an area of ​​less than 500 sq. M will not pay tax, and those who own a larger area will pay this tax only from excess). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298264/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298264/</a></p>
