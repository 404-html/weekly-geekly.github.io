  <section class="page js-page"><h1>In a section: the news aggregator on Android with backend. Introduction, idea, technology</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It so happened that I had to do a job that I liked and that I thought was good, I had to change to a more stable and profitable, but not so interesting one - the work of a line manager in the information department in a large bank.  To say that this work is the exact opposite of the former is difficult, but it doesn’t have anything that was in development: drive, the need to solve complex problems, learn new technologies, what to say - there wasn’t even English (I didn’t want to lose knowledge of it).  Frankly, despite the claimed flexibility and advanced technology, in many banks reigns IT-scoop and manual labor. <br><br>  Time passed, and with it came the understanding that further work in the framework of the current position would not only narrow my horizons, but also deprive any competitive opportunities in the labor market.  Third-party job as a programmer did not give the necessary systematic approach. <br><br>  In this regard, it was decided to study new technologies in the field of development on the basis of a small home project (knowledge gained from books and the Internet without experience disappeared very, very quickly).  The necessary knowledge was the time to allocate for my development I could always. <br><br>  As a project, the idea of ​​implementing a news aggregator (with a client on Android) and its server side for collecting, processing, storing and presenting data was chosen. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Further narration will not be about how I made a client in 2 days, but about how I, in the form of the founder, architect, developer and designer of my small startup, tried (and at the time of writing these words I am still trying) to create a product using modern tools: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/334514/">version control system</a> ; </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/334592/">build system</a> ; </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/334730/">sequential integration system</a> ; </li><li>  integrated development environments for Java and Android; </li><li>  storage system ready artifacts; </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/335340/">Java Crawl Library</a> ; </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/335608/">configuration control system</a> ; </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/336650/">monitoring system</a> ; </li><li>  container virtualization system; </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/336650/">data visualization system from monitoring systems</a> ; </li><li>  non-relational storage system; </li><li>  distributed search engine; </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/347990/">distributed message processing system</a> ; </li><li>  natural language analysis system; </li><li>  probabilistic thematic models operating in distributed systems; </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/343446/">Android based mobile client</a> ; </li><li>  libraries for developing Android applications. </li></ul><br>  From the listed means / technologies it becomes clear that the main goal is not the final product, but the process of its creation and study of technologies and development / maintenance / monitoring tools that can enable the required number of people to work with the project and monitor the condition of your child. <br><br>  Schematically, the project components can be represented as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/986/37d/8aa/98637d8aae8c4a39bea2fac2c64982bc.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Someone may say that this is an unnecessarily complicated architecture for a simple news aggregator and that such simple functionality can be implemented without any server side at all.  Perhaps it is so, but for me it’s still a project for learning technologies - in this case, the result is secondary (at least until the first user is running in it). <br><br>  Further posts will be devoted to each topic (or several topics at once) from those indicated and will contain interesting links, will describe the features of their use in my project. <br><br>  Perhaps, they will seem to some not serious and will repeat the decisions that have long been used in their work, but for someone they will be a source of ideas for use in their work / project. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/334510/">https://habr.com/ru/post/334510/</a></p>
