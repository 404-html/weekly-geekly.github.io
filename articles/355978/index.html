But not all</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dd6/4fb/53b/dd64fb53b0b9e8320ba9fb91fd9be409.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Three UK Store</i> <br><br>  The provider of mobile communications and mobile Internet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_UK">Three Group</a> , operating in Europe, announced that in collaboration with the company Shine Technologies is <a href="https://thestack.com/cloud/2016/02/19/mobile-operator-three-group-to-block-online-advertising/">starting to develop a blocking of mobile advertising</a> .  In a <a href="http://www.threemediacentre.co.uk/news/2016/shine-announcement.aspx">press release, the</a> company clarified that not all advertising will be blocked, but only "inappropriate" and "unlimited".  Begin the experiment divisions of the company Three Italy and Three UK. <br><br>  Three Group explains that they do not set out to destroy mobile advertising, but only want to give users the opportunity to more easily manage the content they want to receive.  According to the company, blocking ads at the network level should work better than blocking through programs installed on the end devices. <br><br>  The operator especially emphasizes that, in his opinion, not advertisers, but advertisers, should pay for downloading advertisements.  Some advertisers violate the privacy of users by embedding in advertising means for secretly tracking them, which is also unacceptable.  Also, users have the right to receive only relevant and interesting advertising, and not spoil the impression of using the mobile Internet due to overly intrusive or inappropriate advertising. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It is known that both advertising appearing on the pages of websites and the one that appears in free mobile applications will be subject to blocking - provided that this advertising is delivered through large advertising networks. <br><br>  The team from Shine Technologies believes that advertising can take away from 10% to 50% of all traffic available to users, which, among other things, spends battery use without any benefit and increases content loading time. <br><br>  Roi Carthy is <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/israeli-ad-blocker-shine-could-threaten-mobile-advertising-2015-5">sure</a> that "ad blocking is everyone‚Äôs right."  He himself claims that he "loves advertising," but that, in his opinion, it needs better control and regulation than it is now. <br><br>  According to some estimates, <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/04/01/mobile-ad-spending-to-hit-100b-in-2016-and-become-the-biggest-digital-ad-market/">more than $ 100 billion</a> will be spent on mobile advertising in 2016, and it will take up about 70% of the total digital advertising market. <br><br>  The Three Group company began its history in the UK with the Three UK operator, which began providing 3G services in 2003.  Three Group is a division of the investment holding company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutchison_Whampoa">Hutchison Whampoa Limited</a> , based in Hong Kong.  Shine Technologies is an Israeli startup that began work in 2011 with the creation of a mobile antivirus and developed its own system for blocking Internet advertising. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/355978/">https://habr.com/ru/post/355978/</a></p>
