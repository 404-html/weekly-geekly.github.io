In addition, we present innovations in Office 365, To-Do and Outlook.com.  These updates have been designed to help you make the most of your time at work, at home, and at all other times.  More under the cut! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zo/ez/nh/zoeznhytx2gyaqyxruhobrrvqck.jpeg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/ru-ru/windows-10-october-2018-update/">This article is on our news portal.</a> <br><br>  It has never been so important for people to have tools designed for all life, since it is precisely today that the boundaries of work and personal life have become very blurred.  Whether you are balancing work and personal life, running a family farm or building your career and continuing education, we hear from you that, above all, you need more time and tools for the most important things. <br><br><h2>  New features in Windows and Office </h2><br><h4>  Your Phone application </h4><br>  No more searching for a phone to write a message.

Take a photo on your Android phone and watch it on your PC.  You can also drag photos from your phone to your PC.  And you can also copy, edit or draw on the photo directly from your PC.  Write personal messages to your friends or in a group by typing them on the keyboard - Your Phone application allows you to view, send and receive SMS from your Android phone on your PC.  Android OS 7.0 and later versions are compatible with Your Phone application.  The app will also help you connect the iPhone with the PC.  Below is a demo video in which you can turn on the translation of subtitles into Russian. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/XO303V2bQsg&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgHgI8e1Jw0KyrjiNeuL1Jh8Fts4A"></iframe><br><br>  IPhone users can browse the websites on the phone, and then instantly send the selected page to the computer to start from where they left off.  You can then read, watch, or search for content using all the advantages of a large screen.  When the phone is connected, continuing to work on the PC is only one step away from you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kl/j9/_4/klj9_4vcrmsdntxnk62i7arhfhs.png"><br><br>  For faster access to the contents of your phone, attach Your Phone application to your desktop or taskbar.  You can also find it in the list of all applications in the Start menu or by pressing the Windows key and entering the name of the application Your Phone in the search bar. <br><br><h4>  Timeline on the phone </h4><br>  In April, we introduced the Timeline for Windows 10 PCs. The purpose of the app is to help avoid the frustrations we face when looking at emails and file folders in search of a missing document.  Timeline helps you easily find what's important on all your devices.  You can also select the desired actions — even if it was on an iOS or Android device — on your Windows PC when you are ready to go back. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/D_5XjZLDFlg&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgze9LxuKjyOVPDkcKeb_jUbyozxg"></iframe><br><br>  Now, the Timeline application from your PC will be available on your phone so that you can go back in time and find the files and websites that you used on your phone, computer or tablet.  You can return to the point where you stopped, whenever that happens.  Easily travel through time, using scrolling to find the files that you worked on earlier today or this week.  Share your actions or at any time remove them from a particular day or hour.  An evaluation version is available for Android starting today through the Microsoft Launcher app, an evaluation version for iPhone will be available soon. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zv/nf/0k/zvnf0kprznae1u3aj3jggqifeko.png"><br><br><h4>  Inking and 3D in PowerPoint and Word </h4><br>  PowerPoint is a powerful tool for visually telling your story, and Word is a canvas for organizing ideas and collaborating on them.  Whether you are creating a concept, teaching or writing an article, it’s now easier to demonstrate your ideas with new Inking and 3D AI-based features that will help you find creative flow and create beautiful content. <br><br><ul><li>  Some people prefer to first sketch their ideas.  We have taken this into account, and now you can sketch ideas, and we use artificial intelligence (AI) to transform them into perfectly formatted slides.  A handwritten list will turn into perfectly formatted text.  Or, if you draw a flowchart or diagram, you can write words and draw forms, and PowerPoint instantly converts them into text and fixed forms. </li><li>  Our design tool for Power Point Designer based on AI is getting smarter.  Now Designer can recommend the design of slides based on handwritten material.  Or, if you prefer typing, Designer can take a simple block of text, understand the context using AI, and then suggest ideas using icons and Smart Art.  To provide even more design options, we add 350 new icons to our library. </li><li>  We add inline animation of 3D models in PowerPoint and Word.  New 3D animation effects will help everyone quickly and easily add movement and animation to slides and documents.  To give you even more creative flexibility, we also added over 30 new animated 3D models. </li><li>  If you like the flexibility of editing Word documents using a digital pen, we also have some good news for you.  Using the Ink Editor, you can already do such things as deleting and selecting text.  Today we are adding new pen movements that make editing the document from start to finish easier, including adding line breaks, inserting new words, and splitting and merging words. </li></ul><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ejpc7HZ6v9c&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhixi6XHrI2qWY-s5oesqxUQSCz18Q"></iframe><br><br>  For the past few years, we have been fulfilling our mission of transforming Office and using AI to simplify daily tasks.  In June, we <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2018/06/13/power-and-simplicity-updates-to-the-office-365-user-experience/">demonstrated a</a> new, fresh design of our Office applications, and just <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/ru-ru/modern-workplace-ignite-2018/">last month</a> we announced new AI-based features for Excel and PowerPoint.  We will be happy to show you what else is new. <br><br>  Most PowerPoint and Word updates will be available to Office 365 subscribers on Windows today.  The ink to Designer feature will appear in the following months.  3D Embedded Animations will first be available to members of the Office insiders program and will be available in the coming months.  Smart Art text and icons will also be available for PowerPoint Online and Mac. <br><br><h4>  Microsoft To – Do </h4><br>  Our To-Do Planner application helps you manage, prioritize, and complete the most important tasks of the day.  To help you keep track of tasks using the most convenient mode for you, today we present the opportunity to update your tasks using the Ink function.  With a digital pen and a Windows-based device with a touch screen, simply add the task to your list using the Ink function, and cross out it when finished.  If you log in to the application using your Microsoft account, your tasks will be synchronized with the To-Do application on iOS, Android or Windows, as well as the Internet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bu/cf/i6/bucfi6q96yd-vca1-ha_6k9fhhm.gif"><br><br><h4>  Outlook.com </h4><br>  More than a year ago, we updated Outlook.com to get millions of users a simpler, smarter, and personalized email account.  Today we present two more updates that will allow you to monitor the implementation of tasks and better interact with your favorite brands. <br><br><ul><li>  The new Task functionality in Outlook.com will help you manage tasks without interrupting your work or leaving your inbox.  Using the power of the To-Do application, you can create tasks by dragging letters into your task list.  Or easily set a schedule by dragging a task into the calendar.  After that, your tasks will be tied to the To-Do application. </li><li>  Is your inbox full of offers and brand news?  Today we are launching a new Outlook.com feature to help you get through the information noise and it’s easier to interact with your favorite brands.  Brands can now get a verification icon to make it easier for you to identify “legitimate” messages in your inbox.  And with new profile cards, you will have quick access to contact information, delivery data, bookings, store addresses, and so on.  You can also easily see which subscriptions you have subscribed to, and cancel one-click subscriptions using the new subscription portal.  And finally, we have simplified the search for proposals in your inbox: you can view the details of the proposal directly in the list of messages so that you do not have to open the letter.  These new features will be available to Outlook.com users in the coming months. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0i/6q/-q/0i6q-q1wzosm6n-u_su5xom0q_s.png"><br><br><h2>  Snip &amp; Sketch (formerly known as Screen Sketch) is now an application. </h2><br>  You can update Snip &amp; Sketch (previously submitted as part of Windows Ink Workspace called Screen Sketch) in Microsoft Store.  Now it will appear in the list when you press Alt + Tab.  You can also set the window size, the application even supports multiple windows. <br><br>  <b>Simple cutting out just a step away from you.</b>  We heard that you want to be able to quickly cut and share a screenshot, and we make it possible!  Now pressing the Windows key + Shift + S will take you to the cut toolbar - use it to cut a rectangle, a freer shape or a full screen, and this cut fragment will fall into your clipboard.  If you only need him, you can take it from there. <br><br>  But suppose you need more.  Immediately after the cut, you will receive an offer to go to the Snip &amp; Sketch application, where you can add annotations and share content. <br><br>  But there is more!  Is the Windows key combination + Shift + S too long to remember?  We added intro options: <br><br><ul><li>  Just a button with a pen image.  If you have a digital pen, go to the Pen &amp; Windows Ink settings - you will see that cutting the screen can now be done in one click.  This will direct you directly to the cutout section below. </li><li>  Click Print Screen.  You already heard this: just one button!  It is not activated by default, so go to Keyboard Settings, where you will see a new option: "Use the button to enable screen-cutting."  Open Settings and enter the “screenshot” request to go to the desired page. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vl/vt/aj/vlvtajpnwsloblvczhiwmtmg00m.png"><br><br><ul><li>  Click the quick action button in the Control Station with the caption: "Cutting the Screen."  It will appear as soon as you update the system, and if suddenly it is not there, you can always turn it on in the Notification Center. </li></ul><br>  <i>Note on the Snipping Tool: as part of the consolidation process and the upgrade of our shipping costs to Windows, when you upgrade your PC to the October 2018 Update, you will see a comment about this in the Snipping Tool.</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-c/us/_n/-cus_n3fqgl2kthnkj7daw7fp_a.png"><br><br>  <i>Note: The Snipping Tool is still available and will continue to be so until the moment our data and user reviews indicate that there is no need to save both versions.</i> <br><br><h2>  Other Windows and Office Updates </h2><br><h4>  General improvements in Microsoft Edge </h4><br>  There are more ways to improve readability, an improved Microsoft Edge appearance / design and more customization options are available: <br><br><ul><li>  Learning Tools: Microsoft Edge is the only browser with built-in Microsoft learning tools (Microsoft Learning Tools) that help you focus. </li><li>  Themes: Choose a theme or color that you like best. </li><li>  Grammar checking tools: mark parts of speech in different colors. </li><li>  Focus: as a ruler card, this feature highlights the lines of text that helps focus and be attentive. </li><li>  Offline dictionary: highlight the word and the definition will appear automatically. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ca/56/5s/ca565s-cifxxbmgwznncuk_aaqe.jpeg"><br><br>  Tools for learning are becoming more diverse: under the tools for learning, available in the form of Reading, you can easily add topics.  Choose the theme color that is most comfortable for you. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/i0iE-wGfoc4&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhJxe_UvDdVLgf2BhI1ym7cMbpbUw"></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/do/jb/ni/dojbnij5yuelxemsu-1x9sp6mag.jpeg"><br><br>  Grammar Checker Tools: Now you can divide words into syllables and highlight parts of speech, such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives.  You can not only select a part of speech, but also change the color or turn on the indicator directly above the selected area to make it easier to determine the part of speech. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-a/45/ij/-a45ijku1k8qte4plosoah23i5c.jpeg"><br><br>  Linear focus: helps to improve concentration when reading, highlighting one, three or five lines. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d0/i1/ga/d0i1gae8dgleb93dbppjx8edl9k.jpeg"><br><br>  Once you set your preferences, you can scroll down the page, and the focus line will move as you read. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/yq/iy/xqyqiyhg30kkxsdfyi-1vpfgdx0.jpeg"><br><br>  Look up reading word definitions for web pages, TIF and PDF files: we added a new dictionary function so you can find keyword definitions when you read an article or document, even online.  Simply select at least one word to see the definition appearing above the selected line. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jg/3v/me/jg3vme2tmcgcneu7bvibjnc1zsm.jpeg"><br><br>  You can also choose to read the word out loud to hear the correct pronunciation or get more information from the definition.  You can also choose whether the definitions will appear and in what types of content they will appear on the General tab of the Microsoft Edge settings menu. <br><br><h2>  Microsoft Edge PDF enhancements </h2><br>  Improved toolbar options: the PDF toolbar can now be triggered by hovering the mouse at the top of the screen, meaning the tools have become more accessible.  The toolbar opens with a PDF document in Microsoft Edge.  Now it shows text descriptions of icons so that they can be quickly understood.  New features such as Add Notes make these handy tools available when needed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ye/js/18/yejs18exc0phm0ds3ksjzsasd3y.jpeg"><br><br>  Attach / detach PDF toolbar: the toolbar can be pinned above documents, with all PDF tools easily accessible when needed.  You can also detach the toolbar to dive into reading.  If the toolbar is not detached, it will disappear by itself — just move the mouse cursor to the top of the page to return it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/li/ot/kg/liotkg7tcozjkvae8_evphryznq.png"><br><br>  Improved rendering: now you will see fewer white pages moving through PDF files. <br><br>  New design improvements: As we continue to reveal how Microsoft Edge uses the Fluent Design System for a more natural and rewarding user experience, you may notice some panel changes.  In the October 2018 update, we add a new depth effect to highlight the active tabs. <br><br>  Revised menu design and options: we heard your opinion that Microsoft Edge settings were too complex for one page.  In this release, we simplify navigation through the Settings, put frequently performed actions forward and in the center, and provide more options for your own settings.  Menu options are now organized into groups, with icons and keyboard shortcuts for each (where appropriate).  Click the "..." button in the top right corner of Microsoft Edge to find out what's new. <br><br>  Customize the toolbar for Microsoft Edge: by clicking "..." on the toolbar, you will find a modified menu that puts the main commands in the center, such as "New Window" and "New Private Window".  We also added the ability to customize which icons appear on the Microsoft Edge toolbar — you can remove them all to make the view more accurate, or add as many as you like to your favorite functions at your fingertips. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wm/wh/zb/wmwhzbayvascuc_2w2ulryy4sts.jpeg"><br><br>  See your key files in the Jump List: now you can see your favorite sites in the Jump List on the Windows taskbar or in the Start menu.  Right-click on the Microsoft Edge icon to see a list of the most frequently visited sites.  Click the right button on a specific text to remove it from the list. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/is/sa/2w/issa2wyeya2dsv3pzr1515uojus.png"><br><br>  Do more with the Downloads panel: we added the options “Show in folder” and “Copy link” in the menu that opens with the right click on the file in the Downloads panel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0p/iy/en/0piyentfulznkctomffmtr95upm.jpeg"><br><br>  Last but not least, with the October Update. The settings will be divided into sub-pages into categories, with clearly organized options and less clutter on each page.  Especially for the convenience of users, new features of the Settings in Microsoft Edge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x5/id/rg/x5idrgj0utd9anb9jm6zkg4-koc.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  Microsoft Edge platform and Enterprise Management updates </h2><br><br>  Web Authentication API: Microsoft Edge now includes <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/russia/2018/08/02/web-authentication-microsoft-edge/">unparalleled support for the new Web Authentication API</a> (or <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/">WebAuthN</a> ).  Web Authentication is an open, scalable and interoperable solution to simplify authentication, which replaces passwords with more reliable credentials associated with the device.  Implementing this programming interface in Microsoft Edge allows you to use Windows Hello (PIN or biometric data) and <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">external authenticators</a> such as FIDO2 security keys or FIDO U2F for secure authentication on web sites. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pw/kc/m0/pwkcm0jjihxaufavn7i6grkgcdu.jpeg"><br><br>  Microsoft WebDriver is now a feature on demand: we have made Microsoft WebDriver a feature on demand (Feature on Demand, FoD), so it’s now easier to get the version that fits your device.  You can install WebDriver by turning on Developer Mode or by going to Settings (Apps)&gt; Apps&gt; Apps &amp; functions&gt; Manage optional features and install as a standalone application. <br><br>  New Microsoft Edge Group Policy: The Microsoft Edge team introduced new group policies and MDM settings for IT administrators to manage Microsoft Edge.  New policies include on / off full-screen mode, printing, the Favorites panel and download history;  prevent certificate certificate bypass;  configure the Home button and launch options;  settings of the quick access page and the URL button “Home” and control permissions.  Learn <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/deploy/change-history-for-microsoft-edge%3Ftabs%3D2018">more</a> about the new Microsoft Edge policy. <br><br>  Users can control video playback on websites: in the October 2018 Update, we added a new setting in Microsoft Edge that allows websites to be allowed or denied to automatically play videos.  You can find this setting in the Advanced settings section&gt; Automatic media playback (Media autoplay), with the ability to customize the behavior according to your preferences: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/65/do/ey/65doeyfxr9hehrvqu19zqgh0wa8.jpeg"><br><br>  If Allow is selected, the site can play the video when you first access it from the active tab.  If you select the "Limit" option, sites can automatically play the video without sound, so that it does not turn on suddenly;  when a user clicks on a page in any part of it, automatic playback for that domain starts again while the tab is open.  If you select “Block” (Block), the site cannot automatically play video unless you turn on video content yourself. <br><br>  Users can enable or block automatic playback at any time, or change the permission to automatically play for each site individually by clicking on the information icon or the lock icon to the left of the address bar and selecting “Manage permissions” to start. <br><br>  Removing the XSS filter: we remove the XSS filter in Microsoft Edge in the October 2018 Update.  Our users will continue to be protected by modern standards such as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP">Content Security Policy</a> , which provides more powerful, efficient and secure mechanisms to protect against attacks with the introduction of content with a <a href="https://caniuse.com/">high degree of compatibility with modern browsers</a> . <br><br><h2>  SwiftKey intelligence is now in Windows </h2><br>  The <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/swiftkey">SwiftKey</a> keyboard provides more accurate automatic corrections and prompts while exploring your writing style — including words that mean something to you, phrases, and emoji.  <a href="http://news.microsoft.com/ru-ru/microsoft-translator-swiftkey/">The program is available</a> for Android and iOS, and starting from October 2018 Update, SwiftKey will be used to enter text in Windows on the touch keyboard for texts in English (US), English (UK), French (France), German (Germany), Italian (Italy), Spanish (Spain), Portuguese (Brazil) or Russian. <br><br>  Windows is now sharing with you analytical insights about how AI helps to efficiently print texts.  If you use a standard keyboard on Windows, there are many features in the input functionality that use AI and machine learning to help you work more efficiently.  Some examples include auto-correcting your spelling mistakes, predictive hints for the next word before typing, suggesting words in the input process, so you don’t have to type the whole word, and display the number of written words — it is called off by a keyboard swipe (yes, You have not tried, try now). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qb/02/up/qb02upixxnhnm7p_19-_uhtwvlw.gif"><br><br>  Windows now shows statistics for each of these functions.  Go to Settings&gt; Devices&gt; Typing and click on the “View typing insights” link to see them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5g/hm/au/5ghmau3tojuwrm__3dkh_rrmphc.png"><br><br>  If you want to leave a review, use <a href="https://support.swiftkey.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">this form</a> . <br><br><h2>  Meet the new clipboard!  (Cloud Clipboard) </h2><br>  We all have to copy and paste texts many times a day.  But what if we need to copy several fragments over and over?  How to copy content from several of your devices?  While working on this issue, we brought the clipboard to a new level.  Just press the Windows key + V, and you will get acquainted with our new clipboard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/26/0d/jo/260djoucuec_9kbilh_mj7hkdxe.png"><br><br>  You can not only insert fragments from the history stored in the buffer, but also attach elements that you use all the time.  This story moves using the same technology as in the Timeline, which means you can access the clipboard from any PC after installing the October 2018 Update or higher update. <br><br>  Go to the new settings page to enable this functionality using the path Settings (Settings)&gt; System (System)&gt; Clipboard (Clipboard). <br><br>  Moving text in the clipboard is supported only for content less than 100 Kb.  Now clipboard history supports plain text, HTML and images less than 1 MB. <br><br><h2>  And here is Emoji 11 </h2><br>  In Unicode 11, 157 new emoji appeared, and they are now available in the October 2018 Update.  The set includes superheroes, red-haired characters, softball, pirate flag and llama.  You can go to them on the Emoji panel (Windows keys + U) or by using the touch keyboard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_k/4b/xl/_k4bxlzpvflmjitrbsg4rrunkki.png"><br><br>  When you receive the October 2018 Update, you will also see changes to existing emodics, such as: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8q/lx/b-/8qlxb-eyqaleszpmjtvcqdbdjsi.png"><br><br>  Our ninja cats also got changes - can you tell the difference? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/by/vd/fp/byvdfp3vcvl69stsqmm5xl4wzgg.png"><br><br>  If you want to leave feedback about our emodzhi or about the process of entering emodzhi, please let us know!  We will be happy for them. <br><br>  The Emoji panel is now available for more than 190 locales. <br><br><h2>  Names of folders for tiles in the Start menu </h2><br>  We have added the ability to name folders for tiles.  To create such a folder in the Start menu, simply drag one tile onto another, hold it for a second, then release.  Continue dragging as many tiles as you like into the folder.  Expanding the folder, you will see an option to specify the name. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h7/rq/8w/h7rq8waqqa-a27dybvzxlvbqvig.gif"><br><br><h2>  Search Improvement </h2><br><h4>  Save time with search previews </h4><br>  Thank you for the positive feedback about the web preview that we added last year.  We are happy to share with you information about new Search improvements: <br><br><h4>  Superior Home Screen </h4><br>  We redesigned the main screen so that you can access the content faster.  Save time and press the keys less while looking through the files you’ve recently opened in the “Start where you left off” section.  Refine your search with a filter to quickly find content on your PC and in the cloud.  Improvements to search in the cloud include the ability to search emails from Outlook.com and documents from OneDrive. <br><br><h4>  Preview all search results </h4><br>  We have expanded the possibilities of preview, including applications, documents, emails, contacts and much more.  The preview saves you time and gives you the information you need, speeding up the beginning and ending of work. <br><br>  Use a preview of the search results to: <br><br><ul><li>  Go back to what you did with the quick access feature to the latest files. Просто найдите приложение, чтобы выбрать файл из списка недавних документов, таких как документ Word или сессия удаленного сеанса. </li><li> Оперативно приступайте к выполнению задач с помощью быстрых действий в превью. Создавайте встречи в Outlook, отправляйте мгновенные сообщения, запускайте PowerShell в качестве администратора, открывайте расположение файлов и многое другое. </li><li> С легкостью сортируйте файлы по расположению, дате последнего изменения и автору. </li><li> Получайте результаты поиска в Интернете, такие как быстрые ответы, новости и веб-сайты, без открытия браузера. Для поиска по видео или изображению выберите опцию в верхней части превью. </li></ul><br> Мы будем постепенно обновлять и улучшать функционал Поиска и добавлять новые возможности. Следите за нашими новостями! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fi/x3/bu/fix3buwyxnpzgwo1hilmzimrckw.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_y/5q/ox/_y5qoxqzzmm944-qsfhlfhdex-o.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kt/2h/li/kt2hliwnz8gxxuk1nsl7dnarzw4.png"><br><br><h4> Поиск теперь доступен в приложении «Календарь» для Windows 10! </h4><br> Теперь вы можете находить прошлые или будущие события, используя поиск по имени, геолокации, участникам или словам в теле события. События, соответствующие вашим критериям, будут четко видны в календаре, при этом остальные будут затемнены, чтобы вы могли быстро найти то, что нужно. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rr/y8/0d/rry80d6tdpidavueorvk5fae9lq.png"><br><br> Поиск работает для учетных записей Outlook.com и Office 365. <br><br><h2> Улучшения смешанной реальности </h2><br><h4> Представляем Mixed Reality Flashlight </h4><br> Сколько раз, когда вы погружались в увлекательную виртуальную реальность, вам вдруг нужно было быстро посмотреть на кого-то рядом, взять напиток, телефон или клавиатуру, а может вам нужно было найти поверхность, чтобы положить игровой контроллер? <br><br> Вы наверняка неуклюже шарили вокруг, снимая гарнитуру, что может выглядеть очень забавно, если у вас в руках игровой контроллер. <br><br> Но сегодня неудобства уходят в прошлое, ведь вы теперь можете смотреть на физическую реальность вокруг с помощью функции Flashlight без необходимости снимать гарнитуру! С выходом обновления Windows 10 October 2018 Update вы сможете открыть портал в свой реальный мир в любое время через меню «Пуск», с помощью комбинации клавиш или голосовой команды. Так вы запустите сквозную передачу видеосигнала с низким значением задержки с камеры, соединенной с вашим игровым контроллером. Это удобное и интуитивное решение, и вам не нужно покидать виртуальный мир. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ty/jn/id/tyjnidaepdvae0xiy0k53gj27ls.png"><br><br> Flashlight наконец-то позволит вам соединить физическую и виртуальную реальность. Попробуйте и расскажите нам, что вы думаете! <br><br><h4> Представляем Быстрые действия </h4><br> Используя приложения с эффектом погружения, вы можете «сходить домой», посмотреть время или запустить инструменты съемки смешанной реальности (Mixed Reality Capture): фото, видео и другие с помощью Быстрых действий. Чтобы включить Быстрые действия в приложении с эффектом погружения, просто нажмите клавишу Windows. <br><br><h4> Транслируйте аудио на гарнитуру и встроенные динамики одновременно </h4><br> Теперь вы можете слышать звук ваших встроенных динамиков, когда Mixed Reality Portal (MRP) выключен, и звук из гарнитуры или встроенных наушников, когда портал смешанной реальности включен. Закройте все приложения, включая MRP, и перейдите в Настройки (Settings) &gt; Смешанная реальность (Mixed reality) &gt; Включить аудио и речь «Когда включен портал смешанной реальности, проигрывать аудио на рабочем столе» (Audio and speech to turn on «When Mixed Reality Portal is running, mirror headset audio to desktop»). Теперь вы будете слышать аудио одновременно из наушников и встроенных динамиков, когда портал смешанной реальности включен. <br><br><h4> Другие улучшения для пользователей Windows Mixed Reality </h4><br> С выходом обновления October 2018 Update в Windows больше не будет необходимости в том, чтобы физический монитор был подключен во время работы Mixed Reality в случае ранцевых ПК. Первичная установка WMR в портале смешанной реальности и разблокировка ПК на экране входа всё еще требует изначального подключения монитора. Тем не менее, вы можете сконфигурировать аудиологин, чтобы не выполнять вход впоследствии. Использование Windows Mixed Reality стоя требует установки ограничителей в комнате. <br><br><ul><li> Мы также внесли некоторые коррективы в инструменты съемки смешанной реальности в обновлении October 2018 Update, чтобы запись можно было останавливать прямо из меню «Пуск». </li></ul><br><h2> Улучшения для гейминга на ПК </h2><br><h4> Улучшения Игровой панели </h4><br> Мы добавили новые функции в Игровую панель: <br><br><ul><li> Доработанный дизайн: более четкий, минималистичный. </li><li> Новые инструменты для управления аудиосистемой: с новой панелью контроля аудио вы сможете лучше управлять вашими индивидуальными аудиоканалами без необходимости покидать игру. </li><li> Игровая панель — теперь приложение: доступ к Игровой панели стал проще, чем когда-либо — с рабочего стола, из приложений, из меню «Пуск» и из Панели задач. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ne/e0/dj/nee0djdjg55oqs7fhj4twhqfoua.png"><br><br><h4> Улучшения в Режиме игры </h4><br> Меньше пауз в игре: основываясь на отзывах геймеров, мы упростили работу Режима игры. Теперь он автоматически включается для всех игр с помощью переключателя в Настройках Windows. Игровой режим блокирует установку драйверов и активности Windows Update, такие как уведомления о перезагрузке, во время игры. Вы можете также заметить улучшение скорости игры с более стабильным параметром FPS, но это зависит от конкретной игры и системы. <br><br><h2> Существенные обновления приложений </h2><br><h4> Большое обновление Skype для Windows 10 </h4><br> Это обновление Skype для Windows 10 дает возможность пользователям Windows 10 оценить преимущества всех новейших возможностей Skype на всех устройствах и платформах — iOS, Android, Mac и Windows. Но только в Windows 10 вы теперь можете использовать функцию «Поделиться» (Share Feature), чтобы быстро поделиться контентом напрямую с вашими контактами в Skype. Если вы просматриваете страницы Microsoft Edge или ищете документ в Проводнике и находите то, чем хотите поделиться, нет необходимости включать Skype. <br><br> Вот что еще вы можете делать в Skype для Windows 10: <br><br><ul><li> Запись звонков — с функцией записи звонков вы можете сохранять разговоры в чатах и возвращаться к ним позднее, чтобы вы не забыли ничего важного. Разговоры сохраняются в облаке, так что вам не нужно беспокоиться о скорости работы вашего устройства или о свободном месте для записи. </li><li> Конфиденциальные разговоры — разговаривайте по Skype, отправляйте сообщения, изображения, аудио- и видеофайлы в режиме сквозного шифрования. Контент в чате зашифрован, чтобы ваша информация оставалась конфиденциальной. </li><li> Темы — вы можете настраивать вид ваших сообщений. Менять их цвет, чтобы сделать чат более праздничным, или придерживаться классических цветов во время деловых переговоров. </li><li> И многое другое — архивируйте разговоры, выключайте звук собеседников в групповом чате, используйте значок @ для упоминаний и многое другое. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pa/-p/3t/pa-p3tiyxzopdeqnmb1_1pivjlu.png"><br><br> Если вы выбрали автоматическую установку обновлений на вашем устройстве Windows 10, вам не нужно ничего делать —эти новые функции будут доступны вами автоматически через обновления Microsoft Store. Как обычно, приглашаем вас присоединиться к нашему <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum%3Fsort%3DLastReplyDate%26dir%3DDesc%26tab%3DAll%26status%3Dall%26mod%3D%26modAge%3D%26advFil%3D%26postedAfter%3D%26postedBefore%3D%26threadType%3DAll%26isFilterExpanded%3Dfalse%26page%3D1">сообществу</a> Skype и присылать ваши отзывы, открыв настройки и выбрав «Помощь и Отзывы» (Help &amp; Feedback). <br><br><h2> Microsoft Forms </h2><br> Microsoft Forms — это простой и компактный инструмент для создания опросов и викторин. Миллионы людей использовали Forms с момента его запуска для образовательных и коммерческих организаций. Сегодня мы расширяем аудиторию ознакомительной версии Forms и включаем в нее всех пользователей. С помощью Forms вы можете без труда создавать опросы, запускать их и анализировать результаты практически отовсюду, на любом устройстве и в любое время. С ответами в режиме реального времени и автоматически генерируемыми рейтингами популярности Forms позволит вам быстро оценить результаты и выбрать правильные дальнейшие шаги. Чтобы начать, вы можете войти в бесплатный аккаунт Microsoft здесь. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lu/ir/p4/luirp4_ld_57yyneqhhqpjtroa4.gif"><br><br><h2> Приложение Microsoft Font Maker </h2><br> С приложением Microsoft Font Maker вы можете использовать цифровое перо, чтобы создать собственный шрифт на основе особенностей вашего почерка — в данный момент приложение <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N9209F8S3VC">доступно</a> в Microsoft Store, и мы будем рады услышать ваши отзывы! Установите шрифты, которые вы создали, чтобы персонализировать всё, что вы делаете. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tq/c1/em/tqc1emwxi9xfwv8dvje1letq2e0.png"><br><br> Сейчас приложение можно использовать для создания англоязычного шрифта. <br><br><h2>  Security </h2><br><h4> Удаленный рабочий стол с Windows Hello Biometrics </h4><br> С обновлением October 2018 Update пользователи Azure Active Directory, Active Directory и Windows Hello for Business могут использовать биометрические параметры для аутентификации на удаленном рабочем столе. <br><br> Эта функция работает с ПИН-кодом Windows Hello, но не работает с обычным ПИН-кодом. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gd/qx/lz/gdqxlzfar0fnbuxudt1ngu4iieo.png"><br><br> Чтобы начать, загрузите подключение к удаленному рабочему столу (mstsc.exe), наберите имя компьютера, к которому вы хотите подключиться, и нажмите «Подключиться» (Connect). <br><br> Поскольку вы пользуетесь Windows Hello for Business, Windows помнит, как вы входите в аккаунт, и автоматически выбирает Windows Hello for Business для аутентификации вас в RDP-сессии, но вы можете нажать «Больше» (More choices), чтобы выбрать альтернативный вариант входа. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d3/sd/i_/d3sdi_goponzau4lylmftg1btwy.png"><br><br> В этом примере Windows использует распознавание лица для аутентификации в RDP-сессии и подключения к Windows Server 2016 Hyper-V. Вы можете продолжить использовать Windows Hello for Business в удаленной сессии, но необходимо будет ввести ваш ПИН-код. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9k/uh/or/9kuhorkrubkr2ugizucdqk0z2yu.png"><br><br><h2> Веб-аутентификация в Windows 10 </h2><br> До настоящего времени авторизация в Windows поддерживала только персональные данные, интегрированные в ADFS или других провайдеров, поддерживающих протокол WS-Fed. Мы представляем «веб-аутентификацию», новый способ входа в ПК Windows. Веб-аутентификация обеспечивает авторизацию в Windows для провайдеров, не интегрированных в ADFS (например, SAML). <br><br> Чтобы включить веб-аутентификацию: <br><br> 1. Подключите Azure AD к вашему ПК Windows (Примечание: веб-аутентификация — единственный поддерживаемый способ аутентификации на ПК, подключенных к Azure AD). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_w/r0/xe/_wr0xejbs_tsmb793kbqikqvriy.png"><br><br> 2. Установите следующие политики, чтобы подключить веб-аутентификацию (Policy CSP/Authentication/EnableWebSignIn). <br><br> 3. На экране блокировки выберите веб-аутентификацию в опциях входа (Sign-in options). <br><br> 4. Нажмите на кнопку «Войти» (Sign In), чтобы продолжить. <br><br><h2> Ускоренный вход на совместно используемые ПК Windows 10 </h2><br> У вас на работе есть совместно используемые ПК? Вы хотите входить в свой аккаунт на ПК быстрее? Начиная с обновления October 2018 Update, мы представляем «Быстрый вход» (Fast Sign-in), который позволяет пользователям моментально входить в свой аккаунт на совместно используемых ПК с Windows 10. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8p/ct/q_/8pctq_or_jh4wgzxw135iey8efw.gif"><br><br> Чтобы включить быстрый вход (Fast Sign-in): <br><br><ol><li> <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/ru-ru/windows/configuration/set-up-shared-or-guest-pc">Установите</a> гостевой доступ или общий доступ на совместно используемом ПК с Windows 10. </li><li> Установите необходимые политики, чтобы включить быстрый вход (Policy CSP/Authentication/EnableFastFirstSignIn). </li><li> С включенными политиками войдите в аккаунт на совместно используемом ПК и почувствуйте разницу. </li></ol><br><h2> Центр безопасности Защитника Windows теперь называется «Безопасность Windows» (Windows Security) </h2><br> Чтобы войти в приложение как обычно, используйте иконку на панели задач. «Безопасность Windows» позволяет вам управлять всеми вашими опциями безопасности, включая антивирус Защитника Windows и файервол Защитника Windows. <br><br><h2> Общие улучшения безопасности Windows </h2><br>  It’s easier to navigate existing threats: we heard your feedback and continued to improve the Virus &amp; threat protection section.  We changed the location of the current threats area (Current threats area), which displays all the threats that require your actions.  You can quickly take action against threats by starting right from this screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dz/gk/dp/dzgkdpsdfdundyvbj0nljlvawy4.jpeg"><br><br>  Improved controlled access to folders: controlled access to folders may not allow malicious and destructive software to change your personal files.  Sometimes the applications that you normally use can be blocked by making changes to shared folders, such as Document and Images, and we heard feedback and made it easier for you to give permissions to recently blocked applications and stay productive using this great function. <br><br>  To allow a recently blocked application to make changes to protected folders, open the Virus &amp; threat protection section, then click Ransomware protection and allow the application access to protected folders.  Then you can press the "Plus" key to open access to the application, and you will be able to add recently blocked applications.  This will open a list where you can choose which blocked items to trust to make changes.  Or you can search for the application manually as before. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ys/d4/vx/ysd4vxmp1ybdsqd3-_qg0hdgoom.jpeg"><br><br>  A more complete overview of your security: we continue to work on how other applications you have installed are shown in the Windows Security application.  This is a new page called Security providers.  Click Manage providers to see a list of all security service providers (including antiviruses, firewalls and web protection) whose solutions are installed on your device.  Here you can easily open the suppliers' applications or get more information on how to solve the problem they reported to you through the Windows Security application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2e/_o/3o/2e_o3oh-0ods-7pr0uppt0ltdvk.jpeg"><br><br>  It also means that you will see more links to other security applications within the Windows Security application.  For example, if you open the Firewall &amp; network protection section, you will see firewall applications that are installed on your device for each type of firewall (domain, private and public networks). <br><br>  Assessment of the state of the new device: in the “Device performance &amp; health” section, we added new assessments of the temporary Windows service.  If we determine that the time on your device is not synchronized with our temporary services or that the time synchronization service is not working, we will help you to turn it on again. <br><br><h2>  Windows Security application updated in Fluent Design style </h2><br>  We have heard your feedback, and when you install Windows 10 October 2018 Update, you will see that we have updated “Windows Security” (Windows Security) to include elements of Fluent Design that you know and love.  You will also notice that we have changed the location and content of the application and now the categories on the main page dynamically change if additional space is needed for additional information.  Last but not least, we also updated the app tiles panel, and now it will use the accent color if you enabled this option in the Color Settings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/67/h8/d-/67h8d-ubn3_0sal3voe513-au-o.png"><br><br><h2>  Windows Defender Firewall now supports Windows Subsystem for Linux Processes (WSL) </h2><br>  You can add specific rules for WSL processes in the Windows Defender firewall, just like for any Windows process.  In addition, the Windows Defender firewall now supports notifications for WSL processes.  In particular, when the Linux tool wants to allow access to a port from the outside (for example, SSH or a web server like nginx), the Windows Defender firewall will offer to allow access in the same way as it would for the Windows process as soon as the port starts accepting connections. <br><br><h2>  Antivirus products requiring startup as a secure process </h2><br>  The Windows Security Center (WSC) service now requires anti-virus products to run as a secure process.  Products that do not yet meet this requirement cannot be present in the Windows Security interface, and Windows Defender antivirus will continue to work along with these products. <br><br><h2>  Windows Guard Defender Improvements </h2><br>  Windows Defender Application Guard introduced a new Windows Security user interface in the October 2018 Update.  Individual users can now set and configure their Windows Defender Application Guard in the Windows Security application without the need to change the registration key or Group Policy settings.  In addition, corporate policy makers will be able to check their settings to see what configuration the administrator has set for their devices and to better understand the behavior of the Application Guard of Windows Defender.  As long as the device meets the minimum requirements, these settings will be visible in Windows Security.  Find out the details <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Windows-Insider-Program/Windows-Defender-Application-Guard-inside-Windows-Security-App/m-p/214102">here</a> (in English). <br><br>  To test it yourself, go to the “Windows Security” application and select “App &amp; browser control”. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rq/mk/y4/rqmky43lav6lueoeizm8jdc0xou.jpeg"><br><br>  In isolated navigation mode, select Install Windows Defender Application Guard.  After installation, restart the device (for independent users only). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1u/b8/6s/1ub86sejriydmlt0ftpp04gnlz0.jpeg"><br><br>  To view or change the settings for Application Guard, select Change Application Guard settings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-b/rt/2g/-brt2g0lvxs_nfwicvmrxxmjyv4.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n3/f9/hg/n3f9hgbhltkj6zik4sm64uufmwc.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  Improved Windows account security </h2><br>  The October 2018 Update update in the Account Protection section of the Windows Security Center now identifies paired devices that are tracked for dynamic blocking.  In cases where several devices are connected to the PC, this user interface indicator will help you easily determine which device is being monitored to block your PC when you leave. <br><br>  You can find out more about the benefits of protecting your account from the video available on the page under the link “Learn more about protecting your account.” <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/db/f9/m_/dbf9m_a6ih3qvfkc8a4hcccln2g.png"><br><br><h2>  Improving free access (special features) </h2><br>  You can enter the Ease of Access settings by going to Settings (Settings)&gt; Free Access (Ease of Access). <br><br><h2>  Make the text larger </h2><br>  Now going to Settings (Settings)&gt; Free Access (Ease of Access)&gt; Display (Display) in the October 2018 Update update, you will see the new option “Make everything bigger).  This slider will change the size of the text in the system, in Win32 applications and universal applications of the Windows platform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hi/9r/jx/hi9rjxcnjgtii7-azhknk9we2g8.jpeg"><br><br>  This means that you can now make the text larger in the Start menu, Explorer, Settings, and so on, without having to change the whole system scale. <br><br><h2>  Magnifier Enhancement </h2><br>  Choose where to leave the mouse cursor: we heard your reviews, in which you ask us to find a way to keep the cursor in the center of the screen in full-screen mode (Full-Screen mode), and with the update of October 2018 Update we make this possible.  This option in Settings&gt; Free Access (Ease of Access)&gt; Magnifier (Magnifier)&gt; Keep Your Mouse ...)&gt; In the center of the screen (Centered on the screen) makes it easier to track and use the mouse, which is especially useful when high magnification. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/aj/kd/r9/ajkdr9g2m2lhnc0wg28kassg5q8.jpeg"><br><br>  More options to increase: you also asked for more zoom options, so we added two new increases: 5% and 10%. <br><br><h2>  Narrator Improvement </h2><br>  Select commands in the Screen Narrator scan mode: Screen Narrator scan mode supports content selection in Microsoft Edge, Word, Outlook, Mail and most text files.  The standard shift-select command can be used along with Control + A to select the entire document.  Caps + Shift + Down Arrow is used to pronounce selected text.  For a complete list of select commands, see the Screen Narrator command list by pressing Caps + F1.  Select the content and copy it to the clipboard by pressing Control + C. Formatting will also be saved. <br><br>  Standard keyboard layout for Narrator: Narrator now comes with a new keyboard layout, which screen reader users are familiar with.  To learn more about these changes, check out the New Narrator keyboard layout <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx%3Fresid%3D6F5C1D5CB00C55A!1063%26ithint%3Dfile%252Cdocx%26app%3DWord%26authkey%3D!AFQJGF6e0OHem-g">document</a> . <br><br>  Auto-Reading Dialogs: The Narrator will now automatically read the contents of the dialog boxes in the foreground.  The function is intended for the Narrator to read the name of the dialog box, the main elements inside it and the static text, if present, at the top of the window.  For example, if you are trying to close a document in Word with unsaved changes, the Narrator will say the Microsoft Word header, the main button “Save” and the static text inside the dialog box. <br><br>  Improving the Keyboard Narrator's keyboard: we added the re-action command in Scan Mode and pronouncing the selected command. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/426327/">https://habr.com/ru/post/426327/</a></p>
