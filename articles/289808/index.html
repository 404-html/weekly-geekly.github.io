  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How professionals work. TM Publisher Denis Kryuchkov</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello!  Today we are announcing a new rubric on the Megamind. <br><br>  Once a week, maybe more often, we will interview geeks to find out how they work.  We will try to figure out what hardware, software and services they use in their work, what they read and how they organize themselves to achieve their goals. <br><br>  Our guest today is TM publisher Denis <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/deniskin/" class="user_link">deniskin</a> Kryuchkov. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/c26/ea2/933/c26ea29333926bde523c583d17601419.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Current Location:</b> <br><br>  Moscow <br><br>  <b>Current place of work:</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://tmtm.ru/">TM</a> , publisher <br><br>  <b>One word that best describes how you work:</b> <br><br>  Initiator <br><br>  <b>Current mobile device:</b> <br><br>  iPhone 6 <br><br>  <b>Current computer:</b> <br><br>  MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2013) <br><br>  <b>Without any applications, programs, utilities you can not live?</b> <br><br>  I will not name specific applications.  I will name technologies without which it will be difficult: fast messaging, storing information in the cloud, geo-services and recommendations. <br><br>  <b>Which life hack helps you save time?</b> <br><br>  In peak hours and in general, if possible, I try to swim against the current.  I leave for work when traffic jams slightly fall down.  Similarly in the evening.  I dine early - from 12 to 13. During these hours they serve faster.  I come back home when everything has already resolved.  From the office to the center I often take the subway - this is the fastest and most predictable transport in Moscow. <br><br>  <b>What kind of to-do manager do you use?</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://asana.com/">Asana</a> and <a href="http://realmacsoftware.com/clear">Clear</a> .  Asana we use in the company for several years.  We are one of the first customers.  Clear I use mainly for personal tasks.  I like the simplicity of the interface. <br><br>  <b>What do you listen when you work?</b> <br><br>  In the office I sometimes listen to the radio.  These are either individual programs on Ekho Moskvy, or music stations - Radio Jazz or one of the channels on the <a href="http://www.di.fm/">di.fm</a> Internet radio. <br><br>  <b>What are you reading now?</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hooked-How-Build-Habit-Forming-Products-ebook/dp/B00HJ4A43S">Hooked</a>  This is a fairly recent book about building habit-forming products.  Quite interesting, especially for those interested in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/hub/growthhacking/">growth hacking</a> . <br><br>  <b>Which book from the last read was remembered the most?</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hatching-Twitter-Story-Friendship-Betrayal/dp/1591847087">"Hatching Twitter"</a> .  Great book about early Twitter.  About how the company was created, how the founders fought for power and glory.  The book has not yet been translated into Russian, but I think it will be translated. <br><br>  <b>Do you use e-readers or prefer paper books?</b> <br><br>  I mostly read from iPad mini.  Less often on paper.  On paper, the last time I read on vacation.  There is nothing better than a paper book on the beach.  You can rustle leaves and hide from the sun, if it interferes. <br><br>  <b>How long do you sleep?</b> <br><br>  On weekdays, I try to stay from 12 to one in the morning.  I get up from 8 to 9. In the morning and / or in the evening I walk the dog.  I try to walk for a walk of at least 1.5 km.  In general, I live by the regime.  When there are children and a dog - otherwise it does not work. <br><br>  <b>How do you have breakfast?</b> <br><br>  For breakfast, we always have oatmeal, something else and tea with lemon.  Sometimes baking.  On weekends, a rich breakfast.  Pancakes, pancakes, fried eggs.  I like to eat from 12 to 13, by this time the stomach after oatmeal is already beginning to give signals.  In cafes and restaurants during these hours less crowded than during peak hours. <br><br>  <b>What advice you have ever been given can you convey to others?</b> <br><br>  I do not remember who the author is, but the advice ‚Äúto think less about what was, but to think more about what will be is one of the best and most useful. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289808/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289808/</a></p>
