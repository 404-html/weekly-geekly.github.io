  <section class="page js-page"><h1>For testing 5G, only two frequency bands are allocated.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The operators of the ‚Äúbig four‚Äù agreed on the joint development of 5G and the deployment of a unified infrastructure, <a href="https://tass.ru/ekonomika/5949187">said</a> Deputy Head of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media Oleg Ivanov.  Since the service is unlikely to become widespread, pooling efforts makes sense to reduce potentially unreliable investments.  On the other hand, the creation of an infrastructure operator <a href="https://rg.ru/2018/12/24/bolshaia-chetverka-gotova-obedinitsia-dlia-razvitiia-setej-5g.html">is important for the state</a> .  In Russia, the 5G development concept was developed at the state level: <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe work [on the development of the 5G development concept] has been completed; it was done by the Research Institute‚Äú Radio ‚Äùin a very high quality.  I gathered all the vice-presidents of the companies, and NIIR reported on this concept to them, we discussed it.  Then we gave it to the LTE Union and the Digital Economy Autonomous Non-Profit Organization for discussion.  The discussion is still ongoing, but at the end of last week an official letter was received from the management of LTU Union that the operators agreed on the infrastructure operator, ‚Äùsaid Oleg Ivanov on December 24, 2018. <br><br>  On the same day, the State Radio Frequency Commission decided to allocate separate radio frequency bands to create 5G pilot zones. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Separate bands for testing are allocated in two ranges: <br><br><ul><li>  4800-4990 MHz; </li><li>  27.1-27.5 GHz. </li></ul><br>  The bands are intended ‚Äúfor the purpose of implementing projects in certain sectors of the economy to an unlimited circle of persons‚Äù  Oleg Ivanov explained that the permission to use frequencies for everyone is connected with the fact that operators may not agree on the creation of an infrastructure operator as a result: ‚Äú[If] this does not happen, we will develop 5G anyway,‚Äù he explained. <br><br>  The initial project provided for the allocation of frequencies for 5G in three much wider ranges: <br><br><ul><li>  3400-4200 MHz; </li><li>  4400-4900 MHz; </li><li>  25.25-29.5 GHz. </li></ul><br>  But the SCRF significantly reduced the list: ‚ÄúThere were many frequency bands in the draft decision.  Unfortunately, there are only two left, because for the rest it is still necessary to carry out the conversion, because they are all busy, ‚ÄùIvanov explained. <br><br>  Megaphone commented that the issued frequencies of 4800-4990 MHz "are not a priority for the operator and can be considered for the development of 5G as a last resort." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/434256/">https://habr.com/ru/post/434256/</a></p>
