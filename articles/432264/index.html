GitLab now gives security professionals more control and empowerment, so they can use it to improve application security and ensure compatibility.  With release 11.5, the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/432264/">group’s</a> new <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/432264/">security panel</a> brings together all the information security specialists may need in a convenient way designed specifically for them.  This panel contains new display options: an overview of the security information of various projects, as well as in-depth information about each of them.  At 11.5 we start with SAST reports, in future releases we will add new reports to this panel.  Our goal is to create a convenient tool, a single security panel that security experts can use instead of switching between a variety of tools. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="novaya-panel-upravleniya-dlya-operatorov">  New control panel for operators </h2><br><p>  Just as the security panel of the group provides security professionals with a wide range of options, the control panel <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/432264/">for operators</a> provides similar capabilities for DevOps specialists.  This panel collects in one place information about all operations on the projects of your instance, including the status of the pipeline and alerts. </p><br><h2 id="upravlenie-dostupom-k-gitlab-pages">  Managing Access to GitLab Pages </h2><br><p>  <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/product/pages/">GitLab Pages</a> is a convenient way to create static content online, for example, documentation for your project.  But what about private projects, where documentation and other files should be available only to project participants?  Previously, to use this feature, it was required to open public access to all additional files, or not to use it at all. </p><br><p>  Starting with the release of GitLab 11.5, you can apply the same access restrictions to GitLab Pages as with tasks and code.  Unauthorized users will receive a page with error code 404 when they try to open such a link.  At the moment <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/432264/">, access control to GitLab Pages</a> works in server copies of GitLab, support is also planned at GitLab.com. </p><br><p>  We are very proud of this feature, as it was contributed by our community.  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/33422">The access control to Pages was</a> requested especially frequently, and as a result, <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-pages/merge_requests/94">this feature was added by community members themselves</a> . </p><br><h2 id="knative-dlya-kubernetes">  Knative for Kubernetes </h2><br><p>  Serverless (“serverless”) application architecture is now much discussed, but often misunderstood.  Some believe that serverless computing implies "Function as a Service" (FaaS), but this is <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html">not entirely true</a> .  In short, serverless architecture allows you to focus on writing business logic, without requiring an understanding of the underlying infrastructure on which your software will run.  Thus, applications and functions can be serverless. </p><br><p>  <a href="https://cloud.google.com/knative/">Knative</a> is a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/knative/">Kubernetes</a> platform designed to create, deploy, and manage modern serverless projects, and in GitLab 11.5 we added the ability to <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/432264/">easily deploy and integrate Knative with GitLab</a> .  You can install Knative <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/kubernetes/">on a connected Kubernetes cluster with</a> one action.  In GitLab 11.5, you can use Knative for your serverless applications, support for <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/43959">serverless functions</a> will be added in 11.6. </p><br><p>  Currently, Knative is still in alpha, but there are many good reasons to deploy applications with it, as it comes with powerful features right out of the box.  For example, Knative monitors the loading of the hearth and can automatically increase or decrease their number without additional configuration.  Knative also has event handling, which makes it easier to manage communications between Producer and Consumer services when deploying microservices. </p><br><h2 id="i-dazhe-bolshe">  And even more! </h2><br><p> There are so many cool innovations in this release that we couldn't fit all of them into the intro.  Further features such as <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/432264/"><code>атрибут parallel</code> for the pipeline</a> , the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/432264/">redesign of the cards on the task board</a> and the initial <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/432264/">integration with Jaeger</a> are waiting for you.  In this release, we have made significant improvements to the code review process, making it easier and more convenient: for example, added the ability to <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/432264/">comment on unchanged code lines in a merge request</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/432264/">preview the merge requester before sending it</a> , automatically <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/432264/">assigning owners of a code to confirm merge request</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/432264/">Direct links to review apps</a> .  Read on and you will learn about all the new features that are included in this release. </p><br><p>  <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/events/">We invite to our meetings</a> . </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f4/2b7/125/1f42b7125b8e58f40d41c3350cac3ffa.png" alt="GitLab MVP badge"></p><br><h2 id="mvphttpsaboutgitlabcomcommunitymvp-etogo-mesyaca--tuomo-ala-vannesluomahttpsgitlabcomtuomoa">  This month's <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/community/mvp/">MVP</a> is <a href="https://gitlab.com/tuomoa">Tuomo Ala-Vannesluoma</a> </h2><br><p>  Tuomo did a great job by implementing <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/432264/">access control to GitLab Pages</a> - a popular feature that many have asked to add.  Private projects can now restrict access to their content, which allows you to create and store internal pages with private information. </p><br><p>  Thank you, Tuomo!  This contribution required significant work in the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/18589"><code>gitlab-ce</code></a> , <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-pages/merge_requests/94"><code>gitlab-pages</code></a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/merge_requests/2583"><code>omnibus-gitlab</code></a> . </p><br><h2 id="osnovnye-fichi-reliza-gitlab-115">  The main features of the release of GitLab 11.5 </h2><br><h2 id="panel-upravleniya-bezopasnostyu-v-ramkah-gruppy-1">  Security panel within the group </h2><br><p>  (ULTIMATE, GOLD) </p><br><p>  Security professionals need to easily obtain information on the current security status of all their projects in order to know which task will be the most important now.  This is even more important for security directors who need to review potential critical vulnerabilities affecting the entire development. </p><br><p>  In the release of GitLab 11.5, we present the first version of the new security control panel available at the group level.  It collects in one place the vulnerabilities identified by <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/sast.html">SAST</a> for all projects of this group and a list of available actions to fix them.  For example, you can create a task with the proposed solution, or simply hide the notification if you think that this is an erroneous response.  Future releases will add support for other tests - Dependency Scanning, Container Scanning, DAST. </p><br><p>  <strong>Note</strong> that the group security panel requires the use of a new syntax for reports <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/README.html"><code>reports</code></a> and a GitLab Runner version 11.5 or higher to display the results.  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/">Auto DevOps support</a> will be added in the next release. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/124/97a/281/12497a281ddafebfeb7654a4e522e908.png" alt="Group security dashboard"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/security_dashboard/">Documentation of the new security panel</a> and the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/6709">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h2 id="panel-upravleniya-dlya-operatorov">  Operator dashboard </h2><br><p>  (ULTIMATE, GOLD) </p><br><p>  For companies and teams using DevOps, it is important to be able to quickly access information about the status of projects. </p><br><p>  Release 11.5 presents a new panel for operators, containing an overview of all important metrics for projects to which the user has subscribed, such as the time since the last deployment, the last commit and active alerts. </p><br><p>  This panel can be configured as a home page for the user, or it can be accessed by clicking on the icon in the top panel. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/445/9b6/6b8/4459b66b86083e1f37ac92726e47c744.png" alt="Operations Dashboard"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/operations_dashboard/">Documentation on the new panel for operators</a> and the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/5781">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h2 id="upravlenie-dostupom-k-gitlab-pages-1">  Managing Access to GitLab Pages </h2><br><p>  (CORE, STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE) </p><br><p>  In the release of GitLab 11.5, we present a stunning feature introduced by the community - access control to GitLab Pages.  Previously, we supported only those cases in which all content on the project was public, but now using Pages you can create and publish protected content, access to which will be open only to project participants.  Operations documents, secret data, plans and other information can now be published confidentially, providing access to it for a limited number of people. </p><br><p>  So far this feature is not connected on GitLab.com, more information <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/5576">on the ticket 5576</a> . </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/67f/3d3/678/67f3d36784f655f5a4f54cb0eabb178b.png" alt="Access control for Pages"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/introduction.html">Documentation on managing access to Pages</a> and the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/33422">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h2 id="razvertyvanie-i-integraciya-knative-s-gitlab">  Knative deployment and integration with GitLab </h2><br><p>  (CORE, STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, FREE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  Creating serverless applications gives teams the opportunity to focus on creating a quality product, eliminating the need to configure and maintain servers. </p><br><p>  Starting with the release of GitLab 11.5, the ability to deploy <a href="https://cloud.google.com/knative/">Knative</a> to your Kubernetes cluster in a single step has been introduced using GitLab integration with Kubernetes.  <a href="https://cloud.google.com/knative/">Knative</a> is a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/knative/">Kubernetes</a> platform designed to create, deploy and manage modern serverless projects.  Previously complex tasks, such as assembling from source to container, traffic management and scaling to 0 (scaling-to-zero) with no load, now work right out of the box. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bfb/202/8dd/bfb2028dd61c84800dcbccb452ed8c2f.png" alt="Known with GitLab"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/clusters/serverless/">Documentation on working with serverless architecture in GitLab</a> and the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/54027">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h2 id="naznachenie-vladelcev-koda-podtverzhdayuschimi-merzh-rekvest">  Assigning code owners to confirm merzh-request </h2><br><p>  (STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  It is not always obvious who should conduct a merge-request review.  Code owners, who are designated to be responsible for specific files, are now automatically assigned as a confirmation merge request. </p><br><p>  With the automatic assignment of confirming merge-requesters, the code owners will be notified of the changes, so that they can review them and approve or not miss the changes. </p><br><p>  Support code owners appeared in the release of GitLab 11.3 ( <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2018/09/22/gitlab-11-3-released/">original article</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/post/425819/">translation</a> ).  In future releases, the degree of participation of code owners in merger-requesting workflows with the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/4418">required confirmation of the owner</a> will increase. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0c0/6d4/59f/0c06d459f070e8275aadfa5b85c15d0c.png" alt="Assign approvers based on Code Owners"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/merge_request_approvals.html">Documentation for confirming merzh-request</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/1012">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h2 id="atribut-parallel-dlya-uskoreniya-raboty-s-konveyerom">  <code>parallel</code> attribute to speed up work with the pipeline </h2><br><p>  (CORE, STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, FREE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  The speed of the pipeline is an important factor for any team, and performing tests or other tasks that can be parallelized usually takes a lot of time for any assembly.  Adding a new keyword - attribute <code>parallel</code> - allows teams to easily parallelize tests, speeding up the software delivery process.  To use this feature, set the attribute the number of threads in which you want to run this task, and GitLab will create the necessary amount of work for your task on its own. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/15a/43e/dc7/15a43edc772b5a31c6b4b2acb85c0f73.png" alt="Parallel attribute for faster pipelines"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/">Documentation of the parallel attribute</a> and the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/21480">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h2 id="drugie-uluchsheniya-v-gitlab-115">  Other improvements in GitLab 11.5 </h2><br><h3 id="kommentirovanie-neizmenennyh-strok-koda-v-merzh-rekveste">  Commenting on unmodified lines of code in a merge request </h3><br><p>  (CORE, STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, FREE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  One of the key objectives of code review is to draw attention to aspects of the proposed changes that may not yet have been considered.  Often these are indications of unintended consequences that may arise in unmodified code. </p><br><p>  GitLab now supports commenting on both modified and unaltered lines of code in a merge request, so you can draw the author’s attention to changes that need to be made.  To display unchanged lines of code when reviewing changes to a merge request, click the ellipsis ( <strong>...</strong> ) button. </p><br><p>  In future releases, we will expand support for commenting on <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/52501">unchanged files</a> . </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1c6/aaa/5dd/1c6aaa5dd4b533ea217813708acf6bf4.png" alt="Comment on unchanged lines in merge request"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/discussions/index.html">Documentation for discussions in merzh-requests</a> and the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/13950">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h3 id="shablony-faylov-dlya-gruppy">  Group file templates </h3><br><p>  (PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  The <code>LICENSE</code> , <code>.gitignore</code> , <code>Dockerfile</code> , and <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> make it easy to add these commonly used files to projects.  Custom file templates can now be shared among all projects in a group and in subgroups if you configure a group template repository. </p><br><p>  Custom templates are useful in cases where the GitLab templates are not suitable: for example, when you need your own license, which is used in all projects of the company, or a complex Dockerfile, which should be used in each microservice. </p><br><p>  Template file support for user instances was introduced in the release of GitLab 11.3 ( <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2018/09/22/gitlab-11-3-released/">original article</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/post/425819/">translation</a> ). </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/697/e13/902/697e13902439ae63a2ee6d61d17a9336.png" alt="Group file templates"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/">Documentation on the template files for the group</a> and the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/5987">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h3 id="pryamaya-ssylka-na-prilozheniya-dlya-revyu">  Direct link to review apps </h3><br><p>  (CORE, STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, FREE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  When you work in a separate branch and change only a few files, you do not need a link to the review applications to take you to the root of the project.  For convenience, we added a drop-down menu to the link to the review applications, which now allows you to navigate directly to the pages of the files you worked with. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/19b/4ba/899/19b4ba89998f4feb1369fd3c0b17fcce.png" alt="Review App direct link"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments.html">Documentation on the direct transition from source files to their pages in the environment</a> and the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/33418">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h3 id="analitika-zadach">  Task Analytics </h3><br><p>  (PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  In this release, we have presented a dynamic diagram showing the number of tasks created in your group per month or over the past year.  We also added a filter that allows you to narrow the search to a specific set of tasks. </p><br><p>  This feature will help teams conduct a deeper analysis of tasks.  For example, you can quickly see how many tasks for the bugs were created if you select the appropriate “bug” mark. </p><br><p>  Here you can see how we plan <a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/313">to expand the possibilities of diagrams</a> .  We ask you to participate in the discussion! </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9bd/aaf/b25/9bdaafb250b78a3a7ccc2126728d88d9.png" alt="Issue Analytics"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/issues_analytics/index.html">Documentation on task analytics</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/7478">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h3 id="predvaritelnyy-prosmotr-revyu-merzh-rekvesta-pered-otpravleniem">  Preview of Merge Requests before departure </h3><br><p>  (PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  Code review is a must-have practice in any successful project, however sometimes it is difficult to provide a clear and executable feedback.  One of the problems is that comments on the code become irrelevant or incomplete as the reader understands what changes have been made by looking at the diff. </p><br><p>  In GitLab 11.4, we presented a feature for a review of merge requests, which allows you to write and send several feedback items in one action.  Starting with this release, you can view reviews of your Merge-Requests before sending them. </p><br><p>  In the next versions we will improve this feature by adding <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/4326">email notifications</a> - one for each review of the merge-request. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/930/98d/b90/93098db90ada8498a476914aeecb66f0.png" alt="Preview merge request review before submitting it"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/discussions/index.html">Documentation for previewing merge requests</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/4327">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h3 id="hranite-svoy-email-v-tayne">  Keep your email secret </h3><br><p>  (CORE, STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, FREE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  When working together on a project, it is important to know who exactly is making changes to the code, and to be able to view the author’s profile through the GitLab interface when using locally or on a host located remotely, but this puts your email on a public display. </p><br><p>  GitLab now provides a <code>noreply</code> address that can be used locally or for web commits, to make it easier for you to keep your email secret. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fab/8b9/080/fab8b908028ce6ec0b12c554fd632895.png" alt="Keep your email address private"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/">Documentation of private email</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/43521">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h3 id="novyy-sintaksis-cicd-dlya-otchetov-po-bezopasnosti-kachestvu-i-proizvoditelnosti">  New CI / CD syntax for safety, quality and performance reports </h3><br><p>  (ULTIMATE, GOLD) </p><br><p>  Prior to GitLab 11.5, reports such as SAST or DAST relied on a combination of task names and artifacts so that the system could recognize their type.  Due to the increased performance requirements for accessing artifacts, such functionality was difficult to scale and maintain more advanced features like Group Security Dashboard.  With the same syntax, you always had to give the work certain names (for example, <code>sast</code> ), but now you can specify any name you like for each work. </p><br><p>  In GitLab 11.5, a new feature was introduced to use the new <code>reports</code> syntax for reports.
