She is driven by an autonomous electric car provided by the plant for the production of exoskeletons and robotic elements to create new artificial medical prostheses.  Kimi works at this plant as a senior engineer for the installation and commissioning of equipment by customers.  Today she has a business trip to another country and to a faraway city, in which new electronic prostheses for a little girl are very much awaited.  These prostheses are in the trunk of an electric car, and in Kimi’s hands is a folder with documents on business trip and equipment.  The folder also contains a ticket for the 14A flight of the ANA Flight # 008 of the new airliner called “The Crystal Sky” and a photo of the little smiling girl Sofia, who is very much waiting for Kimi's arrival on 06.28.2017 to San Francisco. <br><br>  At check-in and loading problems with containers from the baggage Kimi did not arise.  Kimi passed the control and started to prepare her work schedule for the next week in the waiting room on the tablet computer.  The bracelet-sensor on her arm showed the data from the self-diagnosis program, that the prostheses are OK, their systems are stable, the batteries are charged, and the parameters fit perfectly to the dimensions that they received from the medical center for Sofia. <br><br>  Announced landing.  Kimi took her seat 14C, listened to the voice of the captain of the ship, who spoke about the ANA Flight # 008 route from Tokyo to San Francisco, and then during take-off she closed her eyes and slowly fell asleep to the lulling sounds of engines.  She prepared and checked the prosthetic configuration all night.  In the porthole, to the left of Kimi, black storm clouds appeared somewhere far away.  Flight ANA Flight # 008 should have passed them tangentially.  And the captain almost did it.  The same lightning winding touched the bottom of the hull of flight # 008 in the luggage compartment area, where Kimi's containers were located.  The bracelet sensor on Kimi’s hand started, flushed, and then evaporated altogether.  Kimi also evaporated with the bracelet ... <br><br>  *** <br><br>  - What would you prefer for lunch today?  - Kimi heard a soft but unusual voice. <br>  Kimi opened her eyes, stood in front of her, or rather even positioned herself, a strange unit very similar to a man, but it was a robot with its head, arms and torso! <br><br>  “Well, I'll come to you later,” the robot steward said even softer and rolled the trolley further along the aisle of the plane. <br><br>  - Attention, weighting and tactile tuning is performed!  - Kimi heard already a female voice from somewhere below below. <br><br>  The chair, in which Kimi sat, began to change.  It widened slightly, deepened in the back area and went up by a dozen centimeters.  On the armrests, where Kimi's hands were lying, small pads, which touched Kimi's wrists, moved forward.  On the monitor on the front of the back of another chair, a picture appeared with the parameters of pulse, pressure, heartbeat and body temperature Kimi.  The readings were a bit overstated, but not critical.  Kimi felt a fresh breeze from above.  This system of ventilation of the 14C began to supply additional portions of oxygen to the comfort zone of its passenger. <br><br>  “I wonder if this is a dream or something unusual is happening here?” Thought Kimi, but decided to calm down a bit so as not to attract additional attention of the 14C robot armchair. <br><br>  Kimi gently touched the screen with her hand in front of her.  There appeared a menu with a choice of options - “call the steward”, “ANA information”, “get to know the weather” and several other incomprehensible items, such as “open the panoramic window”, “enter the virtual interface” and “electronic line in the bathroom”. <br><br>  Choosing to "find out the weather," Kimi gasped softly.  The screen showed weather information at the point of arrival (correct, according to this Kimi ticket).  But the date of arrival was 06.28.2037.  At this moment, Kimi raised her hands to her face, trying to close the escaping scream, but found that she did not have a wristband on her arm.  Instead, just a small strip of slightly darkened skin around the wrist. <br><br>  “Let's say it happened (something with time and space), try to understand why this happened and how I will continue to be,” Kimi thought.  The engineer is always an engineer, even in fantastic situations.  She tried to rise from the chair and look around.  But it was not easy, because the chair seemed to envelop Kimi.  Thus, Kimi could move relatively freely, but she could not get up.  Standing up and resting her arms on the armrests, she saw a very spacious and bright cabin.  Two lanes between the seats were free, and the third one went around with a trolley, apparently a robot steward. <br>  “Okay, let's start with a simple one,” Kimi thought and clicked on the “call the steward” screen. <br><br>  After a few seconds, there was a quiet rustle, and around Kimi, a robot-steward appeared with his unusual cart.  In the proportions and limbs of the robot, Kimi saw something familiar. <br>  "Oh!  So this is a robo-product as if from the prototypes of our plant! ”Kimi remembered <br><br>  Indeed, the manner of movement, mechanics, arms and legs of the robot, his facial expressions were only in development in the adjacent department of Kimi, she saw tests of some samples at the testing grounds and in the workshop laboratory.  Now Kimi saw the working model alive, even saw the emblems of her plant on the elbows and knees of the robot! <br><br>  “I ask you to choose,” said the robot-steward and handed Kimi the tablet menu and stood waiting. <br><br>  Kimi looked at the tablet and at the cart in front of the robot - there were several columns with closed containers above and below several boxes with drawers.  No food smelled or even water or any liquids could be seen on the trolley. <br><br>  On the tablet, it was possible to choose several dishes and drinks.  Kimi pressed a sandwich with pate, mineral water and a towel.  On the trolley, the box in the tank rumbled in from above, and the drawer came out from below, from which the robot-steward deftly pulled out the sandwich bag, put it on the tray, put water on the same tray.  At this time, the 14C robot seat under Kimi shifted slightly back, and a small table came out of it, on which the robot-steward put a tray.  He also put a warm and wet towel there. <br><br>  - Bon appetit, - said the robot-steward and drove on. <br><br>  “Okay, let's have a snack and start to understand the situation with a fresh mind!” Thought Kimi, took the sandwich with one hand, and the second pressed the “ANA information” button on the screen. <br><br>  - Do you want to listen to flight safety information or the history of the ANA?  The robo chair asked. <br><br>  “Let's start with security,” Kimi replied. <br><br>  The image of the plane appeared in the section. <br><br>  “Your safety is our life,” began a small lecture with pictures on the screen. <br>  It turns out that each passenger seat in the cabin is equipped with a robotic universal seat, which also serves as the main rescue element.  It is made in the cocoon format, in which every passenger feels most comfortable and comfortable.  In the event of unforeseen situations, it is enough for the passenger to just be in the seat; further actions to organize the passenger's safety should be performed independently by the robo chair.  In the most critical case, the robo chair is transformed into a protective closed armored cocoon that can save its passenger even with the complete destruction of the aircraft structure. <br><br>  In the event that the passenger is outside the seat in the cabin, then the robot-steward is responsible for his safety.  Also, a robot steward uses a special food replicator to organize the delivery and delivery of drinks and food to passengers. <br><br>  - How interesting and wonderful!  And now tell, please, about the history of the development of ANA, - asked Kimi. <br><br>  “The sky is our new Earth,” the lecture with pictures on the screen continued on the history of ANA. <br><br>  Twenty years ago, when the world began a new fuel crisis, and transport companies rushed to look for new opportunities for their old development models, the ANA changed this order.  Began the development and introduction of new types of transport devices - modular airborne units, from which you can assemble both medium-range and long-range aircraft. <br><br>  It turns out that ANA, in conjunction with the Tokyo plant for the production of exoskeletons and robotic elements, at which Kimi worked, developed and implemented for two decades such modules for the improvement of aircraft elements: <br><br>  - robot-steward (first implementation 08/08/2019) - a robotic humanoid android with artificial intelligence that can replace on board a steward, mechanic, cleaner, technicians; <br><br>  - Robo-seat (the first introduction of 02.03.2020) - is responsible for the safety of passengers during landing and descent, is also an individual rescue capsule for the passenger during the entire flight; <br><br>  - the system of food replicators (first implementation 03.01.2021) - is responsible for providing passengers with almost any form of food that can be imagined, any dish is generated using food printers and issued to the passenger on his order; <br><br>  - ion-photon solar batteries (first implementation 10/05/2024) - are responsible for the smooth operation of new aircraft engines at an altitude above five thousand meters, world scientists have discovered a new way to save and generate solar energy, batteries are located on the wings and the upper part of the aircraft body; <br><br>  - plasma inversionless engines (first implementation 11/06/2028) - are responsible for the preservation of the environment with the minimum cost of biofuel, the maximum use of energy from ion-photonic solar cells; <br><br>  - magnetic captures and launch pads for landing and take-off of aircraft (first introduction 03.10.2032) - now you do not need to release the landing gear when landing - a smart landing strip will smoothly rotate the aircraft to the ground, and if there are gusts of wind or bad weather, this does not prevent soft landing in no way.  The same take-off of the aircraft takes place with the help of starting magnetic acceleration.  Now not only aircraft began to be equipped with smart systems, but also the airports themselves; <br><br>  - modularity of all aircraft structures (first implementation 04/08/2035) - now it was possible to prepare and assemble an airplane of any configuration in one hour in a robotic hangar at the airport - wings with solar panels, engines and a modular building for a different number of seats, at the end of the assembly Robo chairs are installed in the plane, which already know the parameters of their passengers from the registration data and prepare their configuration for them.  That is why the robo chair under Kimi began to change - there was no primary data about the passenger. <br><br>  Kimi sat back in the robo chair.  Too much information like cold water spilled on her.  She could not even conceive of much of this. <br><br>  “You need to relax a little” - Kimi thought and pressed the “open panoramic window” button. <br><br>  Although Kimi was sitting on the left near the window of the porthole, she could not even think that this was possible - a frame about a meter by a meter was formed above her in the plane, <br>  inside this frame a breathtaking view of the blue sky has opened. <br><br>  "Probably at night there is just a magnificent sight opens," thought Kimi. <br>  Kimi imagined herself a bird, as if she were flying next to a plane.  The view in the panoramic window was soothing and simple.  It was very soothing and relaxing. <br>  “Now I have two buttons not explored” - thought Kimi and pressed “enter the virtual interface”. <br><br>  Small four light bulbs (two for each armrest) were advanced from the armrests of the robo chair and a light sphere a little larger than a basketball was formed in front of them.  On the sphere there was an inscription "touch me." <br><br>  Kimi felt like Alice in Wonderland.  True, there was "drink me" and "eat me."  Probably, the developers of this solution were also fans of Lewis Carroll. <br><br>  Kimi touched the index finger to the sphere. <br><br>  - There is no information about your data, only guest mode is available or enter your credentials separately, please, - a voice from the sphere sounded. <br><br>  “Of course not, where can they come from here,” thought Kimi. <br><br>  But how the sphere could get the data from Kimi's finger and check them on its base was incomprehensible.  Maybe this interface also scanned the face and retina remotely.  It was interesting and Kimi really wanted to know the details. <br><br>  “Activate guest mode,” Kimi asked. <br><br>  A green surface appeared on the sphere with the words "guest mode, use hand control". <br><br>  Kimi knew and knew how this works, but she came across this interface for the first time.  Hands could twist the sphere.  It could be expanded simply by taking and pushing its boundaries.  Inside the sphere were different programs - Internet browsers, gaming and television applications.  Kimi really wanted to go to the news department and read information about the current day and what happened in the last twenty years in the world.  But she understood that perhaps her time was limited here, but it’s better to try to study the real objects and systems of the aircraft as much as possible.  Having traversed a simple user who had reached the terminal, Kimi forced her to turn on the inquisitive engineer, squeezed and closed the information sphere, pressed the bottom button on the screen “electronic line to the bathroom”. <br><br>  - At the moment the room is free, you can visit it, please go to the tail end of the plane along track number two or into the front of the plane along track number one, the passage pattern on the screen, - said the robo-chair and started to push Kimy out of it a bit lifting the back of the chair and the lower part so that Kimi could easily get up and go where necessary. <br><br>  “That's why I couldn't get up earlier,” Kimi thought. <br><br>  Kimi climbed out of the robo chair, the side of the chair 14C turned green.  It is very convenient not to look for the number of your seat upon return, but simply go to the green color. <br>  After stretching her legs and arms, Kimi decided to go first to the front of the plane along the first long lane.  Along the sides and in the middle of the plane, there were four rows of robo chairs, between them there were three lanes.  A part of the robo-chairs was lit in the side in blue, the passengers were sleeping there, some were glowing in yellow, there were open panoramic windows, only Kimi's robo-chair and another chair in the tail of the plane glowed green. <br><br>  The cabin was quiet.  As if the plane was floating above the ground, and not rushing at a tremendous speed at high altitude.  The sound of the engines was almost indistinguishable. <br><br>  Kimi walked a bit forward along the aisle, moms sat in some robots with the children, some passengers worked with the virtual sphere, watched entertainment programs or communicated using video applications. <br><br>  At the very beginning of the cabin was a robot steward. <br><br>  - Something to help you?  He asked very quietly. <br><br>  - No, - said Kimi, - I just decided to warm up a little. <br><br>  “Then go to the end of the cabin to the sector with simulators, there are any to choose from, you can use them during the entire flight,” the robot-steward kindly suggested. <br><br>  - Thank you, be sure to go there, - said Kimi. <br><br>  She was still amazed at how many discoveries she had already made and what awaits her ahead. <br><br>  On the way back, Kimi walked along a different path, passed another robot steward, who, near the robot chair with his mother and two children, tried to make a little clumsy figure toy out of oblong small balloons. <br><br>  "It will be necessary to take into account that such servicing robots not only have to fulfill their direct duties, but also provide them with the opportunity to show additional opportunities for communication with passengers and self-study," Kimi noted. <br>  She walked past her robo chair, which seemed to even miss her passenger and pulsed a little with light waiting for Kimi to be there. <br><br>  At the end of the cabin there was a large sector for recreation and various simple sports training.  The sanitary room was also not small, as Kimi was used to, but rather large and comfortable.  Moreover, these rooms were immediately four in a row to minimize the queues of passengers. <br><br>  As previously explained, each plane is “assembled” modularly at the rate of the number of passengers, cargo of baggage and the required distance of flight before departure.  And all the modules are also calculated from the passenger data and are completed before departure.  Rest rooms and other comfort zones are also modularly installed according to the number of passengers. <br><br>  It’s very convenient if you bought tickets for the flight and registered forty passengers, and an hour before the departure ten more passengers decided to go on the same flight, then a plane with fifty-five robots, five robots-stewards, five lounges, etc. will be prepared in the service hangar. .d  That is, for a certain number of passengers, one number of aircraft modules is assembled and then scaled when the flight is assembled. <br><br>  And the limit on the maximum and minimum number of passengers is now becoming more blurred.  This all makes it more flexible and convenient organization of the airline ANA. <br><br>  Kimi came out of the rest room, in front of the cabin an old elderly woman walked over to her, held by a young girl.  This girl had very familiar eyes. <br><br>  “I have already seen you somewhere,” Kimi thought. <br><br> — София, прошу тебя, я могу сама пройти несколько метров до этой комнаты, — слышался голос женщины. <br><br> — Миссис Пилигрим, мне не сложно помочь Вам, тем более, что я выполняю свою работу, а Вы моя подопечная на этом рейсе, — услышала Кими ответ девушки. <br><br> — Ну хорошо, только постарайся не перетруждать себя, ведь у тебя такие необычные ножки, на них, наверное, сложно и непросто стоять, — уже немного с упреком, но очень мягко ответила миссис Пилигрим. <br><br> — У меня это уже законченная версия робо-протезов, которые не доставляют никаких неудобств, — ответила София, — авиакомпания ANA следит за своими сотрудниками и они ни в коем случае бы не разрешили мне работать на этом рейсе, если был бы хоть небольшой намек на дискомфорт с этими устройствами. <br><br> Кими все поняла, эта девушка и была уже той выросшей девочкой Софией, которой Кими везла протезы. Но те протезы, которые были в багажном отделении рейса ANA Flight #008 в 2017 году были еще прототипом, с которым девочке придётся учиться заново ходить, а вот внешний эстетический вид для них вообще не прорабатывался. <br><br> Сейчас же Кими и не могла бы сказать, что эта девушка использует робо-протезы, так как внешне, по элегантной походке, по ее улыбке, нельзя было бы сказать, что тут есть какая-то загадка. <br><br> Кими обрадовалась, что София нашла свое призвание, а ANA ей в этом помогла. <br><br> Мир за пределами рейса ANA Flight #008 в промежуток между 2017 годом и 2037 годом изменился, но самое главное, что он остался миром. Теперь в нем стало больше роботизации, а люди перестали быть просто потребителями, они начали еще больше заботиться об окружающей среде, хранить память о прошлом и развивать новые технологии, усовершенствуя и внедряя самые лучшие из них в обиход и технические сферы. <br><br> Кими вернулась обратно в робо-кресло 14С. Нажала на экране «узнать погоду», она увидела, что скоро будет посадка, а рядом будет грозовой фронт. Самолет пройдет мимо него. Кими закрыла глаза, взлет и снижение ее всегда убаюкивали. И только маленькая молния из прошлого опять извилистым путем коснулась снизу корпуса рейса #008 уже в районе робо-кресла 14С. На экране монитора кресла впереди картинка с параметрами пульса, давления, сердцебиения и температуры тела Кими пропала, как и Кими из робо-кресла 14С рейса ANA Flight #008. <br><br>  *** <br><br> Кими открыла глаза. Браслет-датчик на руке был немного теплый. Параметры контейнера с оборудованием были в норме. И на часах браслета было время 06.28.2017. <br><br> Рядом с Кими сидели взволнованные пассажиры рейса ANA Flight #008. В салоне стоял небольшой гвалт. <br><br> Капитан корабля говорил по радио, что приблизительно в 1,500 морских миль от Западного побережья Соединенных Штатов они попали в странное штормовое облако, которое не должно быть на такой высоте. Но сейчас все в порядке и самолет прилетит как положено к месту назначения. <br><br> Кими оказалась обратно в своем настоящем мире, где ее ждала будущая стюардесса ANA София. <br></div></div><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To my great surprise, the organizers from XPRIZE not only warmly accepted my material, but even sent a small picture of A3 format as a present for these works. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wp/up/sw/wpupsw1jzvupqrwccpunsykpxcg.jpeg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">→ Link to </font></font><a href="http://seat14c.com/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">the contest website</font></font></a> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Video contest content:</font></font><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8EQxTXg-idQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/426167/">https://habr.com/ru/post/426167/</a></p>
