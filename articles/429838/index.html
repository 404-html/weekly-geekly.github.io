The variable can be accessed in the program, working in this way with the value assigned to it. <br><br>  By itself, a variable in JavaScript does not contain information about the type of values ​​that will be stored in it.  This means that by writing a variable, for example, a string, you can later write a number into it.  Such an operation will not cause an error in the program.  That is why JavaScript is sometimes called "untyped" language. <br><br>  Before using a variable, it must be declared using the <code>var</code> or <code>let</code> keyword.  If we are talking about a constant, the keyword <code>const</code> .  It is possible to declare a variable and assign it some value without using these keywords, but this is not recommended. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Var var keyword</font> </h3><br>  Prior to the ES2015 standard, using the <code>var</code> keyword was the only way to declare variables. <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">var a = 0</code> </pre> <br>  If you omit <code>var</code> in this construct, then the value will be assigned to an undeclared variable.  The result of this operation depends on the mode in which the program runs. <br><br>  So, if the so-called strict mode (strict mode) is included, the similar will cause an error.  If strict mode is not enabled, an implicit variable declaration will occur and it will be assigned to the global object.  In particular, this means that a variable implicitly declared in this way in a certain function will be available after the function completes.  Usually, it is expected that variables declared in functions do not “go beyond” their limits.  It looks like this: <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">function notVar() { bNotVar = 1 //лучше так не делать } notVar() console.log(bNotVar)</code> </pre> <br>  The console will get <code>1</code> , usually no one expects such behavior from the program, the expression <code>bNotVar = 1</code> does not look like an attempt to declare and initialize a variable, but as an attempt to access a variable that is external to the function (this is quite normal).  As a result, the implicit declaration of variables confuses those who read the code and can lead to unexpected program behavior.  Later we will talk about functions and areas of visibility, but in the meantime try to always, when the meaning of a certain expression is to declare a variable, to use specialized keywords.  If in this example the function body is rewritten as <code>var bNotVar = 1</code> , then an attempt to launch the above code snippet will result in an error message (you can see it in the browser console). <br><br>  For example, it may look like this: <code>Uncaught ReferenceError: bNotVar is not defined</code> .  Its meaning is that the program cannot work with a non-existent variable.  It is much better, when you first start the program, to see such an error message than to write incomprehensible code that is able to behave unexpectedly. <br><br>  If, when a variable is declared, it is not initialized, it is not assigned any value to it, it will automatically be assigned the value <code>undefined</code> . <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">var a //typeof a === 'undefined'</code> </pre> <br>  Variables declared with the <code>var</code> keyword can be repeatedly declared again by assigning new values ​​to them (but this can confuse the person who is reading the code). <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">var a = 1 var a = 2</code> </pre> <br>  You can declare several variables in one expression: <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">var a = 1, b = 2</code> </pre> <br>  The scope of a variable (scope) is the area of ​​the program in which this variable is available (visible). <br><br>  A variable initialized with the <code>var</code> keyword outside of a function is assigned to a global object.  It has a global scope and is accessible from anywhere in the program.  If a variable is declared using the <code>var</code> keyword inside a function, then it is visible only inside this function, being a local variable for it. <br><br>  If in the function, using <code>var</code> , a variable is declared, the name of which coincides with the name of a variable from the global scope, it will “overlap” the global variable.  That is, when accessing such a variable inside a function, its local variant will be used. <br><br>  It is important to understand that blocks (code areas enclosed in braces) do not create new scopes.  A new scope is created when the function is called.  The <code>var</code> keyword has a so-called functional scope, not a block scope. <br><br>  If a variable is declared in the function code, it is visible to the entire function code.  Even if a variable is declared using <code>var</code> at the end of the function code, it can also be accessed at the beginning of the code, since the JavaScript variable lifting mechanism (hoisting) works.  This mechanism "raises" the declaration of variables, but not the operation of their initialization.  This can be a source of confusion, so make it a rule to declare variables at the beginning of a function. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Let Keyword let</font> </h3><br>  The let keyword appeared in ES2015, which, simply, can be called the “block” version of <code>var</code> .  The scope of variables declared using the <code>let</code> keyword is limited to the block, statement, or expression in which it is declared, as well as nested blocks. <br><br>  If the word “let” itself does not seem very clear, one can imagine that the word “let” is used instead.  Then the expression <code>let color = 'red'</code> can be translated into English like this: “let the color be red”, and into Russian like this: “let the color be red”. <br><br>  When using the <code>let</code> keyword, you can get rid of the ambiguities that accompany the <code>var</code> keyword (for example, you won’t be able to declare the same variable twice using <code>let</code> ).  Using <code>let</code> outside of a function, say, when initializing loops, does not create global variables. <br><br>  For example, this code will cause an error: <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">for (let i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {   console.log(i) } console.log(i)</code> </pre> <br>  If, at the initialization of the cycle, the counter <code>i</code> will be declared using the <code>var</code> keyword, then <code>i</code> will be available outside the cycle, after it finishes its work. <br><br>  Nowadays, when developing JS programs based on modern standards, it is possible to completely abandon <code>var</code> and use only the keywords <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> . <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">▍ Keyword const</font> </h3><br>  Values ​​of variables declared using the <code>var</code> or <code>let</code> keywords can be overwritten.  If instead of these keywords <code>const</code> used, then a new value cannot be assigned to a constant declared and initialized with its help. <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">const a = 'test'</code> </pre> <br>  In this example, the constant <code>a</code> cannot assign a new value.  But it should be noted that if <code>a</code> is not a primitive value, like a number, but an object, using the keyword <code>const</code> does not protect this object from changes. <br><br>  When they say that an object is written to a variable, they actually mean that an object reference is stored in the variable.  This link cannot be changed, and the object to which the link leads can be changed. <br><br>  The <code>const</code> keyword does not make objects immutable.  It simply protects against changes references to them, written in the corresponding constants.  Here's what it looks like: <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">const obj = {} console.log(obj.a) obj.a = 1 //работает console.log(obj.a) //obj = 5 //вызывает ошибку</code> </pre> <br>  In the <code>obj</code> constant, at initialization, a new empty object is written.  Attempting to access its a property, a non-existent, does not cause an error.  The console gets <code>undefined</code> .  After that we add a new property to the object and try to access it again.  This time, the value of this property is set to the console - <code>1</code> .  If you uncomment the last line of the example, an attempt to execute this code will result in an error. <br><br>  The <code>const</code> keyword is very similar to <code>let</code> , in particular, it has a block scope. <br><br>  In modern conditions, it is quite possible to use to declare all entities whose values ​​are not planned to change, the keyword <code>const</code> , resorting to <code>let</code> only in special cases.  Why?  The thing is that it is best to strive to use the simplest available designs as possible in order not to complicate the program and avoid mistakes. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Data types</font> </h2><br>  JavaScript is sometimes called "untyped" language, but this does not correspond to the real state of affairs.  True, you can write values ​​of different types to variables, but there are data types in JavaScript, after all.  In particular, we are talking about primitive and object data types. <br><br>  In order to determine the data type of a certain value, you can use the <code>typeof</code> operator.  It returns a string indicating the type of the operand. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Ри Primitive data types</font> </h3><br>  Here is a list of primitive JavaScript data types: <br><br><ul><li>  <code>number</code> </li><li>  <code>string</code> (string) </li><li>  <code>boolean</code> (boolean) </li><li>  <code>null</code> (special value <code>null</code> ) </li><li>  <code>undefined</code> (special value <code>undefined</code> ) </li><li>  <code>symbol</code> (symbol, used in special cases, appeared in ES6) </li></ul><br>  Here, the data type names are given in the form in which the <code>typeof</code> operator returns them. <br><br>  Let's talk about the most commonly used data types from this list. <br><br><h4>  Type number </h4><br>  Values ​​of type <code>number</code> in JavaScript are represented as 64-bit double-precision floating-point numbers. <br><br>  In the code, numeric literals are represented as integers and fractional numbers in the decimal number system.  To write numbers you can use other methods.  For example, if at the beginning of a numeric literal there is a prefix <code>0x</code> - it is perceived as a number written in hexadecimal notation.  Numbers can be written in the exponential representation (in such numbers you can find the letter <code>e</code> ). <br><br>  Here are examples of writing integers: <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">10 5354576767321 0xCC // шестнадцатеричное число</code> </pre> <br>  Here are fractional numbers. <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">3.14 .1234 5.2e4 //5.2 * 10^4</code> </pre> <br>  Numeric literals (this behavior is also characteristic of some other primitive types), when attempting to refer to them as objects, automatically, for the duration of the operation, are transformed into corresponding objects, which are called “object wrappers”.  In this case, we are talking about the object wrapper <code>Number</code> . <br><br>  Here, for example, looks like an attempt to access the variable <code>a</code> , in which a numeric literal is written, as an object, in the Google Chrome console. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5d6/775/b97/5d6775b97a38b1ba71d05c32b212e14f.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Number Object Wrap Tips</font></i> <br><br>  If, for example, you use the <code>toString()</code> method of an object of type <code>Number</code> , it will return a string representation of the number.  The corresponding command that can be executed in the browser console (and in the usual code) looks like this: <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">a.toString()</code> </pre> <br>  Notice the double brackets after the method name.  If you do not put them, the system will not give an error, but, instead of the expected output, the console will be something that does not look like the string representation of the number 5 <br><br>  The global <code>Number</code> object can be used as a constructor, creating new numbers with it (although it is almost never used in this form), it can also be used as an independent entity without creating its instances (that is, certain numbers represented from its using).  For example, its <code>Number.MAX_VALUE</code> property contains the maximum numeric value that can be represented in JavaScript. <br><br><h4>  Type string </h4><br>  Values ​​of type <code>string</code> are sequences of characters.  Such values ​​are specified as string literals enclosed in single or double quotes. <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">'A string' "Another string"</code> </pre> <br>  String values ​​can be broken down into multiple parts using the backslash (backslash) character. <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">"A \ string"</code> </pre> <br>  A string can contain so-called escape sequences interpreted when a string is output to the console.  For example, the sequence <code>\n</code> means a newline character.  The backslash character can also be used to add quotes to strings enclosed in the same quotes.  Escaping the quotation character with <code>\</code> causes the system not to perceive it as a special character. <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">'I\'ma developer'</code> </pre> <br>  Strings can be concatenated using the <code>+</code> operator. <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">"A " + "string"</code> </pre> <br><h4>  Pattern Literals </h4><br>  In ES2015, the so-called patterned literals, or patterned strings, appeared.  They are strings enclosed in backquotes ( <code>`</code> ) and have some interesting properties. <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">`a string`</code> </pre> <br>  For example, you can substitute certain values ​​in template literals that are the result of evaluating JavaScript expressions. <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">`a string with ${something}` `a string with ${something+somethingElse}` `a string with ${obj.something()}`</code> </pre> <br>  Using back quotes simplifies multi-line writing of string literals: <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">`a string with ${something}`</code> </pre> <br><h4>  Type boolean </h4><br>  In JavaScript, there are a couple of reserved words used when working with logical values ​​— this is <code>true</code> (true) and <code>false</code> (false).  Comparison operations, such as <code>==</code> , <code>===</code> , <code>&lt;</code> , <code>&gt;</code> , return <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> . <br><br>  Logical expressions are used in constructions like <code>if</code> and <code>while</code> , helping to control the program flow. <br><br>  It should be noted that where <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> is expected, other values ​​can be used that are automatically regarded by the language as true (truthy) or false (falsy). <br><br>  In particular, the false values ​​are the following: <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">0 -0 NaN undefined null '' //пустая строка</code> </pre> <br>  The remaining values ​​are true. <br><br><h4>  Type null </h4><br>  JavaScript has a special <code>null</code> value that indicates the absence of a value.  Similar values ​​are used in other languages. <br><br><h4>  Type undefined </h4><br>  The value <code>undefined</code> written to a variable indicates that the variable is not initialized and has no value for it. <br><br>  This value is automatically returned from functions whose result is not explicitly returned, using the keyword <code>return</code> .  If the function accepts a certain parameter that, when called, is not specified, it is also set to <code>undefined</code> . <br><br>  In order to check the value for <code>undefined</code> , you can use the following construction. <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">typeof variable === 'undefined'</code> </pre> <br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">▍Objects</font> </h3><br>  All values ​​that are not primitive have an object type.  We are talking about functions, arrays, what we call "objects", and many other entities.  All of these data types are based on the <code>object</code> type, and they, although in many ways different from each other, have much in common. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Expressions</font> </h2><br>  Expressions are fragments of code that can be processed and obtained on the basis of the performed calculations a certain value.  There are several categories of expressions in JavaScript. <br><br><h4>  Arithmetic expressions </h4><br>  Expressions fall into this category, the result of which are the numbers. <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">1 / 2 i++ i -= 2 i * 2</code> </pre> <br><h4>  String expressions </h4><br>  The result of evaluating such expressions is strings. <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">'A ' + 'string' 'A ' += 'string'</code> </pre> <br><h4>  Primary expressions </h4><br>  Literals, constants, references to identifiers fall into this category. <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">2 0.02 'something' true false this //контекст выполнения, ссылка на текущий объект undefined i //где i является переменной или константой</code> </pre> <br>  This also includes some key words and JavaScript constructs. <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">function class function* //генератор yield //команда приостановки/возобновления работы генератора yield* //делегирование другому итератору или генератору async function* //асинхронное функциональное выражение await //организация ожидания выполнения асинхронной функции /pattern/i //регулярное выражение () //группировка</code> </pre> <br><h4>  Array and Object Initialization Expressions </h4><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">[] //литерал массива {} //объектный литерал [1,2,3] {a: 1, b: 2} {a: {b: 1}}</code> </pre> <br><h4>  Boolean expressions </h4><br>  In logical expressions, logical operators are used, the result of their calculation is logical values. <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">a &amp;&amp; b a || b !a</code> </pre> <br><h4>  Property Access Expressions </h4><br>  These expressions allow you to access the properties and methods of objects. <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">object.property //обращение к свойству (или методу) объекта object[property] object['property']</code> </pre> <br><h4>  Object creation expressions </h4><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">new object() new a(1) new MyRectangle('name', 2, {a: 4})</code> </pre> <br><h4>  Function Declaration Expressions </h4><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">function() {} function(a, b) { return a * b } (a, b) =&gt; a * b a =&gt; a * 2 () =&gt; { return 2 }</code> </pre> <br><h4>  Call expressions </h4><br>  Such expressions are used to call functions or methods of objects. <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">ax(2) window.resize()</code> </pre> <br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Work with objects</font> </h2><br>  Above, we have already encountered objects, talking about object literals, calling their methods, accessing their properties.  Here we will talk about objects in more detail, in particular, we will consider the mechanism of prototype inheritance and the use of the <code>class</code> keyword. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Рот Prototype inheritance</font> </h3><br>  JavaScript stands out among modern programming languages ​​in that it supports prototype inheritance.  Most object-oriented languages ​​use a class-based inheritance model. <br><br>  Each JavaScript object has a special property ( <code>__proto__</code> ), which points to another object that is its prototype.  The object inherits the properties and methods of the prototype. <br><br>  Suppose we have an object created using an object literal. <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">const car = {}</code> </pre> <br>  Or we created an object using the <code>Object</code> constructor. <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">const car = new Object()</code> </pre> <br>  In any of these cases, the prototype of the <code>car</code> object is the <code>Object.prototype</code> . <br><br>  If you create an array that is also an object, its prototype will be an <code>Array.prototype</code> object. <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">const list = [] //или так const list = new Array()</code> </pre> <br>  You can check this as follows. <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">car.__proto__ == Object.prototype //true car.__proto__ == new Object().__proto__ //true list.__proto__ == Object.prototype //false list.__proto__ == Array.prototype //true list.__proto__ == new Array().__proto__ //true</code> </pre> <br>  Here we used the <code>__proto__</code> property, it does not have to be available to the developer, but you can usually access it.  It should be noted that a more reliable way to get a prototype of an object is to use the <code>getPrototypeOf()</code> method of the global <code>Object</code> . <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">Object.getPrototypeOf(new Object())</code> </pre> <br>  All properties and methods of the prototype are available to the object that has this prototype.  Here, for example, how their list for an array looks. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3d4/9e5/abf/3d49e5abf535b680cdd52d4749bbe61b.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Array hint</font></i> <br><br>  The basic prototype for all objects is the <code>Object.prototype</code> . <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">Array.prototype.__proto__ == Object.prototype</code> </pre> <br>  <code>Object.prototype</code> no prototype. <br><br>  What we saw above is an example of a chain of prototypes. <br><br>  When trying to access a property or a method of an object, if there is no such property or method of the object itself, they are searched in its prototype, then in the prototype prototype, and so on until the required one is found, or until the prototype chain is not over. <br><br>  In addition to creating objects using the <code>new</code> operator and applying object literals or array literals, you can create an instance of an object using the <code>Object.create()</code> method.  The first argument passed to this method is the object that will become the prototype of the object created with it. <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">const car = Object.create(Object.prototype)</code> </pre> <br>  You can check if a certain object is in the prototype chain of another object using the <code>isPrototypeOf()</code> method. <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">const list = [] Array.prototype.isPrototypeOf(list)</code> </pre> <br><h4>  Constructor functions </h4><br>  Above, we created new objects using the constructor functions already existing in the language (when they are called, the <code>new</code> keyword is used). Такие функции можно создавать и самостоятельно. Рассмотрим пример. <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">function Person(name) { this.name = name } Person.prototype.hello = function() { console.log(this.name) } let person = new Person('Flavio') person.hello() console.log(Person.prototype.isPrototypeOf(person))</code> </pre> <br> Здесь мы создаём функцию-конструктор. При её вызове создаётся новый объект, на который указывает ключевое слово <code>this</code> в теле конструктора. Мы добавляем в этот объект свойство <code>name</code> и записываем в него то, что передано конструктору. Этот объект возвращается из конструктора автоматически. С помощью функции-конструктора можно создать множество объектов, свойства <code>name</code> которых будут содержать то, что передано при их создании конструктору. <br><br> После создания конструктора мы добавляем в его прототип функцию, которая будет выводить в консоль значение свойства <code>name</code> объекта, созданного с помощью этой функции. Все объекты, созданные с помощью этого конструктора, будут иметь один и тот же прототип, а значит и пользоваться одной и той же функцией <code>hello()</code> . Это несложно проверить, создав ещё один объект типа <code>Person</code> и сравнив его функцию <code>hello()</code> с функцией уже имеющегося в примере объекта (имя функции в таком случае записывают без скобок). <br><br><h3> <font color="#3AC1EF">▍Классы</font> </h3><br> В стандарте ES6 в JavaScript пришло такое понятие как «класс». <br><br> До этого в JavaScript можно было пользоваться лишь вышеописанным механизмом прототипного наследования. Этот механизм непривычно выглядел для программистов, пришедших в JS из других языков. Поэтому в языке и появились классы, которые, по сути, являются «синтаксическим сахаром» для прототипного механизма наследования. То есть, и объекты, созданные традиционным способом, и объекты, созданные с использованием классов, имеют прототипы. <br><br><h4> Объявление класса </h4><br> Вот как выглядит объявление класса. <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">class Person { constructor(name) {   this.name = name } hello() {   return 'Hello, I am ' + this.name + '.' } }</code> </pre> <br> У класса есть идентификатор, который можно использовать для создания новых объектов с применением конструкции <code>new ClassIdentifier()</code> . <br><br> При создании нового объекта вызывается метод <code>constructor</code> , ему передаются параметры. <br><br> В классе можно объявлять методы. В нашем случае <code>hello()</code> — это метод, который могут вызывать все объекты, созданные на основе класса. Вот как выглядит создание нового объекта с использованием класса <code>Person</code> . <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">const flavio = new Person('Flavio') flavio.hello()</code> </pre> <br><h4> Наследование, основанное на классах </h4><br> Классы могут расширять другие классы. Объекты, созданные на основе таких классов, будут наследовать и методы исходного класса, и методы, заданные в расширенном классе. <br><br> Если класс, расширяющий другой класс (наследник этого класса) имеет метод, имя которого совпадает с тем, который есть у класса-родителя, этот метод имеет преимущество перед исходным. <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">class Programmer extends Person { hello() {   return super.hello() + ' I am a programmer.' } } const flavio = new Programmer('Flavio') flavio.hello()</code> </pre> <br> При вызове метода <code>hello()</code> в вышеприведённом примере будет возвращена строка <code>Hello, I am Flavio. I am a programmer</code> . <br><br> В классах не предусмотрено наличие переменных (свойств), свойства создаваемых с помощью классов объектов нужно настраивать в конструкторе. <br><br> Внутри класса можно обращаться к родительскому классу с использованием ключевого слова <code>super</code> . <br><br><h4> Статические методы </h4><br> Методы, описываемые в классе, можно вызывать, обращаясь к объектам, созданным на основе этого класса, но не к самому классу. Статические ( <code>static</code> ) методы можно вызывать, обращаясь непосредственно к классу. <br><br><h4> Приватные методы </h4><br> В JavaScript нет встроенного механизма, который позволяет объявлять приватные (частные, закрытые) методы. Это ограничение можно обойти, например, с использованием замыканий. <br><br><h4> Геттеры и сеттеры </h4><br> В классе можно описывать методы, предваряя их ключевыми словами <code>get</code> или <code>set</code> . Это позволяет создавать так называемые геттеры и сеттеры — функции, которые используются для управления доступом к свойствам объектов, созданных на основе класса. Геттер вызывается при попытке чтения значения псевдо-свойства, а сеттер — при попытке записи в него нового значения. <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">class Person {   constructor(name) {     this.userName = name   }   set name(value) {     this.userName = value   }   get name() {     return this.userName   } }</code> </pre> <br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Results</font> </h2><br> В этом материале мы поговорили о переменных, о типах данных, о выражениях и о работе с объектами в JavaScript. Темой нашего следующего материала будут функции. <br><br>  <b>Dear readers!</b> Если вы уже давно пишете на JS, просим рассказать о том, как вы относитесь к появлению в языке ключевого слова class. <br><br> <a href="https://ruvds.com/ru-rub/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ba/550/d25/1ba550d25e8846ce8805de564da6aa63.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/429838/">https://habr.com/ru/post/429838/</a></p>
