Why did these guys develop a completely new modular design for Android applications?  There are desktop applications, web applications, why did they need to invent a completely new way of writing software?  Indeed, in a sense, this is confusing to the developer.  Because, let's say, I used to write my small program in C with the main function, and so I look at it and say: “what the hell?  What will I do with all this?  I have to define four kinds of components and send intentions, instead of using C-structures and writing code in regular lines "? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-o/g5/eh/-og5ehnmkqhu8kwsmf__jk4nliq.jpeg"><br><br>  So, what are the pros and cons of existing application models?  We have desktop and Internet applications, why do we need a third type of application? <br>  <b>Student:</b> but the model has changed completely, right?  I think that you should not trust desktop application developers as much as mobile application developers.  In addition, you have more experienced users compared to the number of experienced users of computer applications, and they want to use a whole bunch of applications isolated from each other. <br><br>  <b>Professor:</b> quite possible.  So, do you think that in the case of desktop applications, we should not trust their developers too much? <br><br>  <b>Student: of</b> course, because there is always a more experienced son or cousin who will help you solve problems with computer programs, but with the phone things are different. <br><br>  <b>Professor:</b> it is, of course, cool that phones do not need a cousin to take care of them.  But from a security point of view, computer programs have one characteristic feature - installing a new application on a computer can be quite a laborious process.  Maybe this is not entirely true, because you can always click on the executable file and start the installation, but I do not think that people regularly install desktop applications.  After all, as a rule, you have a fixed set of software that you run. <br><br>  In this sense, a distinctive feature of web applications is their easy launch.  You just go to the site, and you do not need to do anything, except to click on the link, and here you are on some new site running a new application.  So this is a pretty good feature of a web application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eb/5p/j0/eb5pj0lojxhiuhrc4tpmotde0bs.jpeg"><br><br>  A bad feature of computer applications is the lack of isolation of the application.  Perhaps this is in a certain way due to the fact that when you install such an application, you completely trust it with everything that is on your computer.  In fact, there is no isolation between the application you install on your laptop and any other program or data that already exists there, while in the case of the web application there is some reasonable isolation.  As long as you trust the Same Origin policy, you are safe.  Therefore, it is safe enough to go to some arbitrary website and start using its application.  If this application does not take advantage of your browser's vulnerabilities, then it will not interfere with the operation of sites opened in other browser tabs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kz/4u/b7/kz4ub7life-ypvt36cn6shmbtgy.jpeg"><br><br>  It seems that web applications are still in a better position, as they are easy to use and isolated.  Why don't these guys use web apps for Android? <br><br>  <b>Student:</b> Web applications contain an operating system within themselves, that is, for example, there is a Firefox OS, which is essentially a mobile Internet OS. <br><br>  <b>Professor: for</b> sure.  You claim that these guys are really wrong.  They did not have to create a new Android OS, but simply make a giant web browser for your phone. <br><br>  <b>Student:</b> at least Mozilla has shown that this is possible. <br><br>  <b>Professor:</b> well, that's pretty fair.  At the very least, it is wiser to follow the path of creating web applications than desktop systems, at least for the phone. <br><br>  <b>Student:</b> since you are making a phone call from a web application, you need to create a completely new API to connect the web application interface with the phone. <br><br>  <b>Professor: for</b> sure.  Thus, web applications have one limitation that can be fixed, the lack of an interface API for some mobile devices.  But such applications are becoming less.  For example, for a camera or for a GPS navigator, they slowly, but still add the corresponding interface to the web applications.  But there, in web applications, probably, there is no API for making calls, sending SMS messages, and so on. <br><br>  Another disadvantage of web applications is the inability to establish limited access to other applications.  We talked about implicit intentions in Android, where you could just say: “I want to see this JPEG image, but who knows which application will open it?  Or I want to view this PDF file, or share this photo I just made with my camera via a friend, but I don’t know which email application will be used. ”  So let's just ask the link monitor to find me some email program that is going to send this photo.  On an Android-based device, this is easy to do, but in the case of web applications, it will be very difficult, as with each interaction you must refer to a specific URL. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hn/ji/3e/hnji3ekontenki2ojybc9j0xcac.jpeg"><br><br>  So if you don’t know which PDF viewer someone is using, then you won’t know which URL you can use to view your file. <br><br>  <b>Student:</b> perhaps the disadvantage of web applications can be considered that JavaScript is very difficult to read? <br><br>  <b>Professor:</b> yes, it is, another disadvantage is that they are all written in JavaScript.  So potentially this may not be very good in terms of performance, it may be difficult to understand what the program does, it may be difficult to compile efficiently, and so on. <br><br>  Let's return to the programs for the computer.  A useful feature of desktop applications is the ability to share files.  All your files are available in each application, because you just share them.  Thus, you have easy access to any data available on your computer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bu/d-/us/bud-usw330kr6amp32vmdnxxmry.jpeg"><br><br>  The fact that it is a bit difficult to implement in Android is easy to do in computer applications.  In the case of desktop operating systems, if I want to compile a piece of software, I will run MAKE, run GCC and possibly some other programs, and they will all work on the same source C code in the same directory.  This is much more difficult to do in Android, where the data is associated with the main application that is stored by the content provider.  So you have to tinker, first using the source code repository, and then installing the C compiler, the MAKE program, the assembler, and so on.  It’s much harder to make them work together. <br><br>  This can be done by circumventing some of the limitations of Android, but in any case more difficult than on desktop systems. <br><br>  <b>Student:</b> I think that optimizing web applications is quite difficult, they are limited by the use of RAM and processing power. <br><br>  <b>Professor:</b> yes, the principles of optimizing web applications and desktop applications are different.  I believe that the disadvantage of web applications, at least when Android was designed, was that it was very difficult to start a web application offline.  If your phone catches a weak network signal, then some applications will be difficult to launch, especially if some parts of them “dropped out” from the cache.  However, I think, as you noticed, web applications, albeit slowly, but “catch up” with Android by eliminating the limitations that exist today.  So it is quite possible that web applications will serve as a reasonable model for launching a new operating platform of the phone.  But five years ago they were not good enough for this. <br><br>  But even despite the existing shortcomings, it will now be much easier to “push” web applications into the niche occupied by Android, rather than start developing a new mobile OS from scratch.  So I think we can still talk about the success of what Android has done, although perhaps today you would prefer not to do it that way. <br>  I think that in terms of isolation, the security of the Android system is much higher.  As I mentioned, Android relies on the Linux kernel to isolate applications from each other.  The Android platform actually sets up user IDs for user IDs, so this App1 app will have a UID of 1001, App 2 will have a UID of 1002, and the reference monitor, which usually has root rights, has a UID of 0. So the Linux kernel is largely responsible for isolation of applications from each other. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3b/el/d1/3beld1duilkkf1mawpmamp6ohe4.jpeg"><br><br>  Basically, the interaction between user IDs occurs through intent intentions.  There are many more nuances about how the Linux kernel manages applications using the UID, we will talk about this a little later. <br><br>  One interesting question: why did these guys choose Java?  What is the role of Java in Android?  Why is it even needed?  If instead of Java we write all applications in C, or, for example, Assembler, something can break? <br><br>  <b>Student:</b> if you have vulnerabilities, the use of these languages ​​can lead to a distortion of important indicators for the system. <br><br>  <b>Professor:</b> Yes, this can happen, for example, in an application, a buffer overflow may occur.  What else? <br><br>  <b>Student:</b> permissions confusion may occur. <br><br>  <b>Professor:</b> with what permissions? <br><br>  <b>Student:</b> with such as latency, latency. <br><br>  <b>Professor:</b> let's look at this in more detail.  So, as we said, the link monitor checks for us tags and actually stores in the “Android” system a list of all installed applications, along with tags that correspond to all these applications.  So, you probably don’t want the link monitor to make mistakes no matter what language it is written in.  So having a link monitor written in a type-safe language is a good solution.  I like Java because it is a type-safe language with good features.  But even if the application were written in C and there was a buffer overflow in it, it still would not be able to damage the tags that are in the link monitor.  So it would not be a big problem. <br><br>  <b>Student:</b> maybe there is some system that can damage the code itself written in C? <br><br>  <b>Professor:</b> Yes, so, in principle, it would be nice to avoid applications that speak directly to the Linux kernel.  In Android, it is not.  Android applications can make arbitrary system calls if they wish.  In fact, for performance reasons, applications cannot affect arbitrary components written in C or Assembler, so some games “speak” Java. <br><br>  <b>Student:</b> I think in some way this is an opportunity to use all the material written for Java, that is, the creators of Android wanted to simplify the creation of applications for developers.  And one of the easiest ways to do this is to create the ability to take advantage of the large Java libraries. <br><br>  <b>Professor:</b> quite possible.  I think one of the main reasons for using Java is usability.  They were probably more concerned with programming and ease of development, since Java has little to do with security. <br><br>  Another thing that has a place here, as opposed to iPnone.  The operating system "iPhone" also has the ease of development, but uses C, and if you try, then it can cause a buffer overflow.  In addition, there is a specificity for a particular equipment, so all can not have the same libraries.  I think that the main reason why Android developers chose Java is because they initially did not know the characteristics of the devices on which this OS will work.  For example, the creators of the iPhone knew for sure that they would have an ARM processor in their phone, so they compiled the software with this model in advance.  And this approach is more efficient, because the battery consumption is of great importance for the phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u5/ib/37/u5ib37bjv0tgmjzbnl44jmy5fxg.jpeg"><br><br>  The fact that Android guys are using Java is probably less effective in terms of power saving or processor performance, because it’s associated with the JRE and so on.  But then there is the advantage of porting the OS to devices with different architectures.  Therefore, if you have phones with MIPS, ARM, or x86 processors, a Java application can be run on all three devices.  The Android developers wanted their platform to be used on any kind of equipment or phone.  So probably this is the main reason why they sacrificed security for Java. <br><br>  It turns out that the Java runtime environment does not provide any special security benefits for applications, it is just a handy thing for developers and users.  But from the point of view of isolation, everything here basically depends on the kernel and the reference monitor that controls the operation of applications. <br><br>  <b>Student:</b> Doesn't simplicity of development lead to some application security?  After all, when writing a monitor of references to C, there are many more ways to make mistakes. <br><br>  <b>Professor:</b> yes, you are absolutely right!  In fact, I should not have said that the ease of development has nothing to do with security.  This is completely stupid, because you want to do it as easily as writing the right code.  So in a sense, a system for which you can easily write the correct code in itself provides greater security.  In a sense, you are right in assuming that the Android developers wanted to avoid mistakes when writing code, so you didn’t want to write it in a complex C language. And I don’t know why Apple chose C as the programming language when developing its OS. <br><br>  Because such a choice creates a buffer overflow problem in the application, and if this application is significant, then it is potentially vulnerable.  Not regarding the compromise of other applications, but you still don’t want your banking application to be written in C. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l2/ck/ld/l2ckldkuplj27qwfud44rw1a_u4.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Student:</b> Link Monitor written in Java or C? <br><br>  <b>Professor:</b> in Android, the reference monitor is mainly written in Java.  However, there are some “hooks” in it in order to communicate with external interfaces and applications that use native code.  But most of the logic is written in Java.  So this is actually quite a safe plan. <br><br>  And now we will try to find out what else UID applications are used for, except for separating applications from each other in terms of the processes they initiate.  The main reason for using a UID is to create the ability to share access to shared resources and exchange data in the system. <br><br>  We have already seen one mechanism for this — sending intent to the monitor of links.  But in Android there are a lot of things that are not executed through the intent of the reference monitor.  Probably not everything is sent via Intent for performance reasons.  You do not want to call the monitor of links for each operation that you do in the system, first of all it concerns access to the Internet.  If you want to go online in a device running “Android”, then just open the socket, just like in any standard Linux application. Приложение может просто попросить ядро: «мне нужен сокет, потому что я хочу подключиться к этой машине», вот каким образом осуществляется доступ к сети Интернет. <br><br> Далее следует отметить доступ к съемным носителям. Если в вашем телефоне есть SD-карта, связь с ней также осуществляется напрямую через ядро. Вообще, любой вид доступа к файловой системе, или, по крайней мере, прямой доступ к файловой системе осуществляется непосредственно через ядро, потому что там уже есть файловая система. Так сделано, чтобы избежать накладных расходов производительности. Кроме того, как и в большинстве аппаратных устройств, Android позволяет приложению напрямую общаться с устройством вместо передачи доступа через монитор ссылок. Это касается таких вещей, как фотокамера, GPS-навигатор, компас и так далее. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ji/tl/-o/jitl-okvoy72n6hos0wm6kqxkwc.jpeg"><br><br> Это «железо» просто появляется в Android, как в Linux, в виде /dev/camera. Это просто устройство Linux, которое вы можете открыть, чтобы получить данные с камеры или управлять камерой любым способом, и так далее. Круто то, что если вы хотите сделать с этим устройством что-то особенное, вы не ограничены тем, что позволяет вам делать Java. Вы всегда можете написать код на C или даже на Assembler, который будет напрямую общаться с ядром и выполнять необходимые операции на этом устройстве Linux, делая произвольные системные вызовы. И вы можете облечь это в собственный Java интерфейс, чтобы удобно представить остальные Java-приложения. <br><br> <b>Студент:</b> но мы ведь всё равно выполняем проверку этих системных вызовов, потому что когда вы открываете сокет, кто-то же должен проверить, разрешено ли этим приложениям открывать сокет? <br><br> <b>Профессор:</b> да, так что это интересная вещь! Ведь теперь эти операции находятся за пределами нашей модели, основанной на намерениях. Так как мы будем их защищать? Этот вид взаимодействий сводится к тому, что вы делали в лабораторной работе №2, вводя в систему ID пользователей. Среда выполнения Android отвечает за тщательную организацию UID и GID приложений в соответствии с политикой, указанной в соответствующих метках. Для каждого из этих ресурсов существует предопределенная строка метки, определяющая права доступа к этому ресурсу. Так что для доступа к сети, я думаю, есть строка, содержащая что-то вроде «android.permission.internet», и это та метка, которую может запросить приложение. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ob/jz/zd/objzzdehqowwxxpcfwgli9p0byk.jpeg"><br><br> И если приложение имеет эту метку в своем наборе привилегий, то оно должно иметь доступ к сети. Метка содержит политику того, как исполняется эта привилегия, то есть указывает, что в результате должно произойти. И механизм исполнения — это небольшое изменение в ядре Linux для в Android. Здесь для того, чтобы сделать какие-либо сетевые системные вызовы, вы должны быть членом какой-то магической группы, то есть не как, как традиционно работают в Linux. В Android существует некая магическая группа с идентификатором GID 3003, и этот номер жёстко закодирован в ядре. Если процесс имеет этот идентификатор группы в своем списке групп, то ему разрешено использовать системный вызов, связанный с сетью. И если нет, то ему не разрешено делать какие-либо сетевые системные вызовы. Вот как Android умеет переводить эти метки во что-то вроде поддержки системной политики, применяя их различным образом. Иногда исполнение инициируется монитором ссылок, иногда оно происходит принудительно путём установки идентификаторов групп GID или пользователей UID соответствующим образом. <br><br> То же самое происходит и с SD-картами. Есть еще один GID, который соответствует доступу к SD-карте, и есть соответствующая строка, которая ему соответствует. То же самое происходит с доступом к файловой системе, но только немного сложнее. Я предполагаю, что SD-карта находится в файловой системе и имеет определенный GID для доступа ко всей SD-карте. <br> В файловой системе телефона существует ещё один вид файлов, в отношении которых соблюдение политики безопасности контролируется не метками, а самим дизайном Android. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/op/ic/gv/opicgvlrgcfbrqm5numaadmwhuy.jpeg"><br><br> Это заключается в том, что каждое приложение имеет личный каталог, который оно использует для хранения любых файлов, которые только захочет. В частности, SQL база данных контент-провайдера, которую вы собираетесь использовать в качестве приложения, хранится в вашем личном каталоге. В отношении него действует такая политика — только UID этого приложения, и никто другой, может получить доступ к данному каталогу. <br><br> Таким образом, для устройств внутри телефона существует механизм, очень похожий на доступ к сети, в котором имеется строка разрешения для доступа к модулю GPS, камере и так далее. И для каждого из них есть GID, используемый в разрешениях на этом устройстве. Так, например, dev/camera принадлежит какому-то магическому GID, и любое приложение, которое должно иметь доступ к этой камере, использует этот GID при необходимости. <br><br> Надеюсь, это было похоже на то, что вы делали в лабораторной работе №2, не в смысле меток, а в смысле использования UID и GID для того, чтобы добраться к какому-то приложению. <br><br> Еще один интересный вопрос заключается в том, почему разработчики системы придумали именно такой способ управления SD-картой? Почему у них нет разных приложений, взаимодействующих с разными частями SD-карты? Вероятно, на моей SD-карте есть много разных вещей, и я не хочу, чтобы приложения имели к ним доступ. Что вы думаете по этому поводу? <br><br> <b>Студент:</b> возможно, это связано с тем, что пользователь должен утвердить разрешения для приложений, и чем их меньше, тем менее вероятно вмешательство приложений в управление картой памяти. <br><br> <b>Профессор:</b> вполне может быть. Определенно, это проблема Android в целом, и мы доберемся до нее через минуту. Но я думаю, что в отношении SD-карты существует немного другая проблема. Это связано с тем, что вы хотите, чтобы SD-карты взаимодействовали с остальным миром. Это похоже на одно из мест, где Android не способен принимать произвольные решения, потому что вы хотите, чтобы карты памяти имели стандартную файловую систему, а именно FAT, потому что де-факто это современный стандарт для хранения данных данные на карте памяти. В результате этого у вас не может быть сложной файловой системы, в которой хранятся разрешения для каждого файла, так что будет трудно каким-то образом разделить эти файлы и дать различным приложениям разный доступ. <br><br> <b>Студент:</b> что, если каждому приложению дать разный доступ к директориям карты? <br><br> <b>Профессор:</b> возможно, что вы могли бы дать каждому приложению другой подкаталог на карте памяти и открыть к нему доступ. Но фактически это будет означать предоставление каждому приложению отдельного хранилища на карте, чтобы лишить его возможности прочитать всё содержимое карты, потому что оно может содержаться в другом каталоге. Конечно, может существовать приложение, которому вы захотите дать доступ ко всей карте или к нескольким каталогам, но не думаю, что у вас будет слишком много вариантов разрешений. Так что вы правы, можно было бы использовать комбинацию из обоих способов доступа. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o_/of/gj/o_ofgjpul-lhm-qyy_dzskzwfba.jpeg"><br><br> Интересно обсудить следующий вопрос — как мы решаем, каким набором меток должно обладать приложение, чтобы получить доступ к конкретным вещам? Например, кто решает, что это приложение должно иметь набор меток DIALPERM, INTERNET, FRIENDVIEW? <br><br> <b>Студент:</b> вероятно, разработчик определяет это в манифесте, чтобы этого не делал пользователь? <br><br> <b>Профессор:</b> да, это в некотором роде авансовая система, в которой разработчик прежде всего перечисляет все вещи, которые он планирует использовать в будущем для обеспечения работы своих приложений. И тогда пользователь несет ответственность за просмотр этого списка и принятие решения о том, все ли в порядке, должен ли он позволить установку этих приложений или нет. Благодаря этому пользователь является важной частью системы с точки зрения безопасности, потому что почти всегда может одобрить или отклонить любые разрешения. Во многих отношениях Android более гибкий, чем iOS, где приложениям, разработанным для iPhone третьей стороной, трудно получить доступ к другим компонентам телефона, набору номера, отправке SMS-сообщений, средствам просмотра JPEG и т. д. <br><br> Цена такой гибкости – это то, что вы должны заставить пользователя проверить, что разработчик запрашивает разумный набор разрешений или что пользователь доверяет этому разработчику иметь такие привилегии. Так что это немного печально. Вероятно, одна из самых больших проблем безопасности Android состоит в том, что пользователи готовы выдать эти разрешения, если они действительно хотят установить данное приложение. Например, я нашёл какое-то приложение и нажимаю кнопку «Установить», и если разрешения для этого приложения представляют собой длинный список, и нет ничего тревожного, что сразу выскакивает на экране, скорее всего, я просто нажму OK. Я могу не тратить время на то, чтобы понять, для чего действительно необходимы эти разрешения. <br><br> Другая неприятность заключается в том, что в то время, когда эта была написана обсуждаемая нами статья, разработчики Android решили, что у пользователя должно быть только два варианта — либо установить приложение, либо не устанавливать. При этом, если пользователю действительно нужно это приложение, он его установит, не смотря ни на что. Поздние версии Android, начиная с 4.3, ввели более детальную схему установки приложений, которая позволяет пользователю выбирать разрешения из списка разрешений, которые разработчик хотел бы иметь для своего приложения. Таким образом, пользователь получил возможность удалять некоторые из этих разрешений из приложения. Остаётся неясным, как обычный пользователь должен этим пользоваться, потому что довольно сложно изучить весь список и принять решение, что разрешать, а что нет. Но, по крайней мере, там начинает появляться API, хотя до сих пор я не видел, чтобы им широко пользовались. <br><br>  55:10 <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/company/ua-hosting/blog/432620/">Курс MIT «Безопасность компьютерных систем».</a>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/ua-hosting/blog/432620/">Lecture 20: "Mobile Phone Security", part 3</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uT7BXusDgDM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br> Полная версия курса доступна <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-858-computer-systems-security-fall-2014/">здесь</a> . <br><br>  Thank you for staying with us.
