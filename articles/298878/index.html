  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Zynga sells headquarters in San Francisco</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f33/2c7/307/f332c73078a74863aed8846b6f79a039.jpg"><br><br>  Today, Zynga officially announced the sale of its main office in San Francisco, and the total number of employees in the company fell to 2,300 from 3,500 at the peak of the company's development.  Initially, Zynga's office was owned by Sega, from which the first bought it for $ 228 million. The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãits headquarters is 62,200 square meters - before that, the company rented 65% of the premises of the building.  Taking into account the "real estate boom" in San Francisco - when selling the value of this office will be much higher. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  For the first time, Zynga announced the official sale of its office during a telephone conference on the results of the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015.  It is noteworthy that Zynga is not going to completely abandon the building - instead, the company is going to lease it in the long term.  If the company can find suitable conditions, the employees will continue to work in the Zynga office without any changes.  As part of the monthly reporting, the company <a href="http://investor.zynga.com/releasedetail.cfm%3FReleaseID%3D954358">reported</a> a drop in its active audience by 9% to 68 million compared to the same period last year.  The company's total revenue for 2015 was $ 765 million. <br><br>  The development history of Zynga begins in 2007, when it was founded, after which the company entered the IPO in 2011 with a market capitalization of $ 9 billion. But from that moment, problems began for the popular game publisher - the share of Zynga on mobile platforms did not increase, and the popularity of projects companies on Facebook fell significantly following the decline in the share of personal computers in the market. <br><br>  In search of a solution, Mark Pincus, founder and head of Zynga, hired Don Mattrick, the former head of Electronics Arts and Microsoft Xbox.  As part of this, Mattrick reduced Zynga's staff and acquired NaturalMotion for $ 527 million, but in the end, in 2015, Mark Pincus was forced to return to the company for the post of CEO in 2015. <br><br>  Despite a significant <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/kamagames/blog/233353/">drop in profits</a> over the past quarters and a market capitalization of just $ 1.9 billion, Zynga still has about $ 900 million in accounts. This allows the company to look to the future with optimism - it is likely that one of the new projects of the company will still be able to return former glory. <br><br>  Other studios also faced problems in the mobile market - after the IPO was released and the value of the publisher‚Äôs shares fell, Activision Blizzard was <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/24284/">swallowed up by the</a> King‚Äôs shares for a record $ 5.9 billion for the European market. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298878/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298878/</a></p>
