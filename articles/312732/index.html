  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Micro DC. What is it?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h2 id="vvedenie">  Introduction </h2><br><p>  Since the cloud theme is now very fashionable, the relevance of the data center is also great.  But if you have an average enterprise size and there is no separate data center as superfluous, then vendors can offer you </p><br><ol><li>  Modular data center. </li><li>  Mini data center.  (miniDC). </li></ol><br><p>  Actually the last and stop.  The name is very beautiful.  But in fact, maybe you already have it.  If not, you can do it. </p><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="chto-eto">  What is it? </h2><br><p>  The proposed solutions in reality are a 19 "server cabinet mounted inside: </p><br><ol><li>  Server (or several). </li><li>  Network devices (switches and routers) </li><li>  UPS. </li><li>  Organizers, patch panels, fans, power panels. </li><li>  Monitoring system. </li><li>  Service contract. </li></ol><br><p>  Everything except paragraph 6 is completely obvious.  Under the service contract, everything becomes clear if we take into account two circumstances.  Warranty periods for all components are different, with the purchase of a contract, the guarantee is given for everything for the duration of the contract.  That is, with a 3-year contract, the fact that UPSs in practice are guaranteed for 2 years from the moments of release, and fans for 12 months, does not matter.  The second important aspect is that no manufacturer manufactures all the components on its own, except for its ODM assembly products and with the guarantee of its internal squabbles. </p><br><p>  From the advantages of this approach.  On the site you choose a set of "giblets" and warranty conditions.  Get ready to connect the cabinet assembly.  The downside is obvious.  Price.  Self-collection will be cheaper. </p><br><h2 id="esli-sobirat-samim">  If you collect yourself. </h2><br><p>  First, remember the ultimate goal.  You will deploy the virtual infrastructure as in a large data center.  Even a private cloud (in practice, rather a hybrid). </p><br><ol><li>  Server (s) clearly think.  Good white is really better.  But you need to understand them well.  Of course, take the HDD hot-plug to the reserve and the second power supply unit.  He is also a hot-plug.  IPMI is a must have. </li><li>  Network hardware.  Every man to his own taste.  Take under the task. </li><li>  UPS.  Online is certainly better, but it is more complex and more expensive than linear-interactive.  In general, the UPS does not protect against disconnection; there is enough time to correctly stop or start the generator.  Online isolates from the network, if it is not so hot, then the server is somewhat more expensive than the difference in the price of different UPS.  I‚Äôm writing with blood, the truth was not burned by the server, but by the VoIP-PSTN gateway, but it came only after two weeks. </li><li>  Cupboard.  From experience, I‚Äôll say, it‚Äôs better to touch it with hands, or 60x80 cm in practice can easily be 60x74-76, and the server 74, and also network plugs ... In short, it‚Äôs not an aesthetic look without a back panel and you can hear the fans.  The same applies to panels, organizers, fans and other things. </li><li>  In general, it is necessary to monitor all devices, but everything is individual. </li><li>  A pack of warranty cards or copies of documents for purchase. </li></ol><br><p>  From the advantages of this option - the price and exact compliance with the tasks / opportunities. <br>  Of the minuses.  Quite a laborious task, requiring qualifications and time. </p><br><p>  In operation, such self-assembly is definitely no worse than miniDC from the manufacturer.  More trouble with the warranty. </p><br><h2 id="vyvody">  findings </h2><br><p>  It is clear that miniDC is just a beautiful name for a widely used solution.  I intentionally did not mention vendors.  The article is not advertising, but Google knows everything.  Say, there is a cabinet made for office clothes.  Until you open a sound you can not hear.  You recognize the price ($ 10K- $ 15K) sounds can not be heard from you.  It's just that if at this stage you take the task seriously, the IT service will definitely have more time to watch movies, educate themselves, discuss sports results, TV shows, gossip and other components of IT culture. </p><br><p>  UPD According to the comments.  mini, micro Datacenter - really 19 "rack with equipment to choose from. <br>  <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fenterprise.huawei.com%252Filink%252Fenenterprise%252Fdownload%252FHW_309519%26usg%3DAFQjCNGzI1HFqPJrRzbTWCK4ZEk9gBWOiQ%26bvm%3Dbv.135974163,d.bGs">Micro DC Huawei</a> The very first google link. <br>  I correct the headline to a more relevant </p></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/312732/">https://habr.com/ru/post/312732/</a></p>
