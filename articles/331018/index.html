  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Lecture on sports programming in the framework of the Intellect project</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good afternoon, dear readers! <br>  Not so long ago, an interesting offline project called Intellections appeared in Yekaterinburg, presenting lectures on modern technologies in our life.  Scientists and experts from various fields are invited to conduct lectures.  According to the organizers of the Intelligences from the Malina.am channel, this is a project about the place of a person in a changing world.  I was able to personally attend one such event and I would like to talk about it in more detail.  If you are interested in this topic, please under the cat. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Lectures are held at the Yeltsin Convention Center.  Participation is free, but registration is required.  You can read more about the project on malina.am website: <a href="http://malina.am/rubrics/intellecture">malina.am/rubrics/inlectlecture</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/921/d3b/2e2/921d3b2e2db7420384f72b0386d65e9d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On June 8, I attended a lecture called Sport Programming.  The multiple winner of the world championships on sports programming and the coach of the Ural Federal University team Mikhail Rubinchik was invited as a lecturer.  The lecture consisted of two parts. <br><br>  In the first part, Mikhail conducted a seminar on the topic of sports programming in a presentation format.  During the seminar, Mikhail Rubinchik explained the idea embodied in sports programming in simple language, presented statistics and facts about the ACM-ICPC championships.  Mikhail also spoke about the process of preparing participants for the championships and about the possibility of participation in the championships for everyone.  An interesting moment was the release of the Ural Federal University team, the bronze medalists of this year‚Äôs World Championship.  The guys told their success stories and shared their future plans. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7da/e8d/f8c/7dae8df8cd78400394722095ab082a27.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the second part, the project manager Ekaterina Degay conducted an open conversation with Mikhail, during which anyone from the audience could ask his question.  During open discussion, issues of IT education, participants' career opportunities and many others were touched upon.  Spectators, for example, were interested in how to help a child in the future to become a participant in the programming championships and on the success of Russian teams at the world championships. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f30/feb/b9b/f30febb9b09e43ed9ca6e51e80876b13.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, the lecture on sports programming left me with a pleasant impression, gave a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis interesting direction in the field of IT and showed interest in sports programming. <br><br>  The full version of the lecture is available: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Re5FdbXWp_M" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The next planned lecture, in which Nikolai Dobrovolsky, co-founder and vice president of Parallels, will talk about the company's success, will be held tomorrow, you can register <a href="https://tkmalina.timepad.ru/event/507942/%3Futm_refcode%3D8544e3a3fc2e94f829a3cb0d6b246b955a690c12">here</a> and read more about the event <a href="https://vk.com/event148740997">here</a> . <br>  The project also has <a href="https://vk.com/intellecture">a</a> Vkontakte <a href="https://vk.com/intellecture">group</a> , where full versions of the past lectures are available. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/331018/">https://habr.com/ru/post/331018/</a></p>
