We are glad to inform you the good news!  The Ridewithme project is even better!  We are releasing an update of our application as well as a version for Android devices!  Now we will be even more!  We changed a lot in our project including icon and name!  Meet - WITHME! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c99/af5/bf2/c99af5bf2f904544811684e0c49ce585.png"><br><br>  Working on the update, we took into account the wishes of all our users.  We wanted to make our product better.  It took a lot of time and effort to re-invent the application. <br>  Let's start by filtering the event list.  Now the filter is simple and convenient.  It still has a choice of the type of classes, as well as filtering events by distance from the user. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/189/e92/cee/189e92ceee8e44efb10365775726b26e.jpg"><br><br>  Using this filter, it is most convenient to monitor what is happening, and a person will always be able to find the nearest interesting activity after work or study. <br><br>  NO CITIES!  Our next idea is to remove cities from the application.  All our cities were tied to the IATA parameter.  In our database, by default, only those cities that have an airport are displayed.  To put it mildly, not all cities have an airport.  This led to the fact that we needed to add cities manually at the request of our users.  Since the number of cities without air routes is simply huge, it was decided to correct the problem in a fundamental way.  We completely removed the city from our application.  Our solution looks better than its predecessor by about 143 percent. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/42a/d31/ee9/42ad31ee971e4edbb19987f6b6d07e2e.jpg"><br><br>  To create an event in your unique place, now you just need to throw a pin on the map where it is needed, that's all!  This enhancement adds additional user experience when creating an event.  If the user does not know where his place of interest is, then in the search box you can enter the name or address of the place. <br><br>  We also worked very closely on the design and title of our project.  We came up with a new icon design, with it we decided to reduce our name to ‚ÄúWithme‚Äù.  Why?  - You ask.  The name change is connected, first of all, with the fact that we decided to expand the range of classes open to users.  Now Withme is not only a way to organize sports events!  Now our app covers all the popular types of hobby, leisure and sports activities, including going to the cinema, theaters, concerts and more.  And the name ‚ÄúSkate with me‚Äù is no longer completely within the updated ideology of the application, so now we, like you, are Withme! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297858/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297858/</a></p>
