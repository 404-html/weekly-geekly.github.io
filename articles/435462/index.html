Anatomy of tests and types of tests</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The author of the material, the first part of which we are publishing today, says that he, as an independent consultant for Node.js, analyzes more than 10 projects every year.  His clients, which is justified, ask him to pay special attention to testing.  A few months ago, he began to take notes on valuable testing techniques and errors he encountered.  The result was a material containing three dozen recommendations for testing. <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/435462/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f16/1a0/3e2/f161a03e2b08ae35b31f718a083a39a0.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  In particular, the discussion here will focus on the selection of test types that are appropriate in a particular situation, on their proper design, on the evaluation of their effectiveness, and on exactly where to place them in the CI / CD chains.  Some of the examples given here are illustrated using Jest, some using Mocha.  This material is mainly focused not on tools, but on testing methodologies. <br><br>  → <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/435464/">Testing Node.js projects.</a>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/435464/">Part 2. Evaluation of the effectiveness of tests, continuous integration and analysis of code quality</a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">▍0.</font>  <font color="#3AC1EF">The golden rule: tests should be very simple and straightforward.</font> </h3><br>  Do you know anyone - a friend, family member, hero of the film, who is always charged with a good mood and is always ready to offer a helping hand, without demanding anything in return?  That is how good tests should be designed.  They should be simple, should be useful and cause positive emotions.  This can be achieved by careful selection of test methods, tools and goals.  Such, the use of which justifies the expenditure of time and effort to prepare and conduct tests and at the same time gives good results.  You only need to test what needs to be tested, you need to strive to ensure that the tests are simple and flexible, and sometimes you can even refuse some tests, meaningfully sacrificing the reliability of the project for its simplicity and speed of development. <br><br>  Tests should not be viewed as ordinary application code.  The fact is that a typical team engaged in the development of a project, in any case, does everything possible to support it in working condition, that is, it seeks to ensure that, say, a commercial product works as expected by its users.  As a result, such a team may not be very well aware of the fact that it will have to support another complex “project”, represented by a set of tests.  If the tests of the main code grow, delaying more and more attention and becoming a cause for constant concern, they either abandon work on them or, trying to maintain at a decent level, give them so much time and effort that it will slow down work on the main project. <br><br>  Therefore, the test code should be as simple as possible, with a minimum number of dependencies and levels of abstraction.  Tests should look like they can be understood at a glance.  Most of the recommendations we consider here stem from this principle. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Section 1. Anatomy of tests</font> </h2><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">▍1.</font>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Design the tests so that the report tells you what is being tested, what scenario, and what is expected from the tests.</font> </h3><br><h4>  Recommendations </h4><br>  The testing report should indicate whether the current version of the application meets the requirements for it.  This should be done in a form that will be clear to those who do not have to be familiar with the application code.  This can be a tester, a DevOps specialist who is involved in the deployment of a project, or the developer himself, who looked at the project some time after writing its code.  This can be achieved in the event that when writing tests to focus on the requirements of the product.  With this approach, the structure of the test can be imagined consisting of three parts: <br><br><ol><li> What exactly is being tested?  For example, the <code>ProductsService.addNewProduct</code> method. </li><li>  What is the scenario and the circumstances under which the test is conducted?  For example, the response of the system is checked in a situation when the price of the goods was not transferred to the method. </li><li>  What are the expected test results?  For example, in such a situation, the system refuses to confirm the addition of a new product to it. </li></ol><br><h4>  Implications of derogation </h4><br>  Suppose the system could not be deployed and at the same time you can only learn from the test report that it did not pass the test, called <code>Add product</code> , which checks for the addition of some product to it.  Will it give information about what exactly went wrong? <br><br><h4>  The right approach </h4><br>  Information about the test consists of three pieces of information. <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">//1. тестируемый модуль describe('Products Service', function() { //2. сценарий describe('Add new product', function() {   // 3. то, чего ждут от теста   it('When no price is specified, then the product status is pending approval', ()=&gt; {     const newProduct = new ProductService().add(...);     expect(newProduct.status).to.equal('pendingApproval');   }); }); });</span></span></code> </pre> <br><h4>  The right approach </h4><br>  The testing report resembles a document containing a statement of product requirements. <br><br>  Here is how it looks at different levels. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f3/172/8fb/1f31728fba16acd94c79d10fbcbb6c02.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Product requirements document, test naming, test results</font></i> <br><br><ol><li>  The product requirements document can either be a special document itself, or it can exist as something like an email. </li><li>  When naming tests, describing the purpose of the test, its scenario and expected results, one should adhere to the language that is used in formulating the requirements for the product.  This will help to compare the test code and product requirements. </li><li>  Test results should be clear even to those who are not familiar with the application code or have forgotten it thoroughly.  These are testers, DevOps specialists, developers returning to work with the code a few months after writing it. </li></ol><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">▍2.</font>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Describe what is expected of the tests in the language of the product: use BDD style statements</font> </h3><br><h4>  Recommendations </h4><br>  Development of tests in a declarative style allows those who work with them, instantly grasp their essence.  If tests are written using the imperative approach, they turn out to be filled with conditional constructions that make their understanding much harder.  Following this principle, expectations should be described in a language close to normal.  In the declarative BDD style, use an <code>expect</code> or <code>should</code> construct, and not some special code of our own design.  If there are no necessary statements in Chai or Jest, and it turns out that the need for such statements often arises, consider <a href="https://jestjs.io/docs/ru/expect">adding new “checks” to the Jest</a> or writing your own <a href="https://www.chaijs.com/guide/plugins/">plug-ins for Chai</a> . <br><br><h4>  Implications of derogation </h4><br>  If you do not follow the above recommendations, everything will end with the fact that members of the development team will write fewer tests and will skip especially annoying checks using the <code>.skip()</code> method. <br><br><h4>  Wrong approach </h4><br>  The reader of this test will have to look through a rather long imperative code only in order to understand what is being tested in the test. <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">it(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"When asking for an admin, ensure only ordered admins in results"</span></span> , ()={   <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">//предположим, что мы добавили тут двух администраторов — "admin1" и "admin2", и пользователя "user1"   const allAdmins = getUsers({adminOnly:true});   const admin1Found, adming2Found = false;   allAdmins.forEach(aSingleUser =&gt; {       if(aSingleUser === "user1"){           assert.notEqual(aSingleUser, "user1", "A user was found and not admin");       }       if(aSingleUser==="admin1"){           admin1Found = true;       }       if(aSingleUser==="admin2"){           admin2Found = true;       }   });   if(!admin1Found || !admin2Found ){       throw new Error("Not all admins were returned");   } });</span></span></code> </pre> <br><h4>  The right approach </h4><br>  You can understand this test literally at a glance. <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">it(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"When asking for an admin, ensure only ordered admins in results"</span></span> , ()={   <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">//предполагается, что тут добавлены два администратора   const allAdmins = getUsers({adminOnly:true});     expect(allAdmins).to.include.ordered.members(["admin1" , "admin2"]) .but.not.include.ordered.members(["user1"]); });</span></span></code> </pre> <br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">▍3.</font>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Perform lint code tests using special plugins</font> </h3><br><h4>  Recommendations </h4><br>  There is a set of plug-ins for ESLint, designed specifically for analyzing test code and for finding problems in such code.  For example, the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-mocha">eslint-plugin-mocha plugin</a> gives warnings if the test is written at the global level (and is not a descendant of <code>describe()</code> ), or if the tests are <a href="https://mochajs.org/">skipped</a> , which can give false hopes that all the tests are passed.  The <a href="https://github.com/jest-community/eslint-plugin-jest">eslint-plugin-jest plugin</a> works in a similar way, for example, warning about tests that have no assertions, that is, those that do not check anything. <br><br><h4>  Implications of derogation </h4><br>  The developer will be happy to see that the code is covered by tests for 90% and at the same time 100% of the tests pass successfully.  However, in this state it will remain only until it turns out that many tests, in fact, do not check anything, and some test scripts are simply skipped.  It remains only to hope that no one will begin to develop in production projects that are "tested" in this way. <br><br><h4>  Wrong approach </h4><br>  The test script is full of errors, which, fortunately, can be identified with the help of a linter. <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">describe(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"Too short description"</span></span>, () =&gt; { <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span></span> userToken = userService.getDefaultToken() <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">// *error:no-setup-in-describe, use hooks (sparingly) instead it("Some description", () =&gt; {});//* error: valid-test-description. Must include the word "Should" + at least 5 words }); it.skip("Test name", () =&gt; {// *error:no-skipped-tests, error:error:no-global-tests. Put tests only under describe or suite expect("somevalue"); // error:no-assert }); it("Test name", () =&gt; {*//error:no-identical-title. Assign unique titles to tests });</span></span></code> </pre> <br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">▍4.</font>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Stick to the black box method - test only public methods.</font> </h3><br><h4>  Recommendations </h4><br>  Testing some internal mechanisms of the code means a significant increase in the burden on developers and does not give almost any benefits.  If a certain API gives the correct results, is it worth spending a few hours testing its internal mechanisms and then still maintaining these tests, which very easily “break”, up to date?  When testing public methods, their internal implementation, although implicitly, is also verified.  Such a test will give an error if there is some problem in the system, which is expressed in the output of incorrect data.  This approach is also called "behavioral testing."  On the other hand, while testing the internal mechanisms of some API (that is, using the “white box” technique), the developer focuses on small implementation details, rather than on the final result of the code.  Tests that check these subtleties may begin to generate errors, for example, after a small refactoring of the code, even though the system continues to produce correct results.  As a result, this approach significantly increases the load on the programmer associated with supporting the test code. <br><br><h4>  Implications of derogation </h4><br>  Tests that are trying to cover the internal mechanisms of a certain system, behave like a shepherd boy from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boy_Who_Cried_Wolf">fable</a> who called the peasants to shouts of “Help!  A wolf! ”When there was no wolf nearby.  People came running to help only to find that they were deceived.  And when the wolf really appeared, no one came to the rescue.  Such tests give false positive results, for example, in cases when the names of some internal variables change.  As a result, it is not surprising that the person who conducts these tests soon begins to ignore their “screams”, which, ultimately, leads to the fact that once a real serious mistake may turn out to be unnoticed. <br><br><h4>  Wrong approach </h4><br>  This test checks the internal mechanisms of the class for no particular reason for such checks. <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span></span></span><span class="hljs-class"> </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-title">ProductService</span></span></span></span>{ <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">//Этот метод используется лишь внутри класса //Изменение его имени приведёт к тому, что тест сообщит об ошибке calculateVAT(priceWithoutVAT){   return {finalPrice: priceWithoutVAT * 1.2};   //Изменение формата результата или имени свойства объекта приведут к отказу теста } //Общедоступный метод getPrice(productId){   const desiredProduct= DB.getProduct(productId);   finalPrice = this.calculateVATAdd(desiredProduct.price).finalPrice; } } it("White-box test: When the internal methods get 0 vat, it return 0 response", async () =&gt; {   //Система не должна позволять пользователям рассчитывать показатель VAT, она лишь должна выводить итоговую стоимость. Но мы, несмотря на это, тестируем тут внутренние механизмы класса   expect(new ProductService().calculateVATAdd(0).finalPrice).to.equal(0); });</span></span></code> </pre> <br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">▍5.</font>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Choose suitable backup objects: avoid mocks, preferring stubs and spies</font> </h3><br><h4>  Recommendations </h4><br>  The use of duplicate objects (test doubles) for testing is a necessary evil, as they are associated with the internal mechanisms of the application.  Without some of them just really impossible to do.  <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">Here is</a> useful material on this topic.  However, different approaches to the use of such objects can not be called equivalent.  So, some of them - stubs (stub) and spies (spy), are aimed at testing the requirements for the product, but, as an inevitable side effect, they are forced to slightly affect the internal mechanisms of this product.  Mocks, on the other hand, are aimed at testing the internal mechanisms of the project.  Therefore, their use leads to a huge unnecessary burden on programmers, which we talked about above, offering to adhere to the black box technique when writing tests. <br><br>  Before using backup objects, ask yourself one simple question: “Do I use them to check the functionality that is described, or could it be described in the technical requirements for the project?”.  If the answer to this question is negative - it may mean that you are going to test the product using the “white box” approach, about the shortcomings of which we have already spoken. <br><br>  For example, if you want to find out if your application is working correctly in a situation where a payment service is not available, you can stop this service and make the application get something indicating that there is no response.  This will check the system's response to a similar situation, find out whether it behaves correctly.  In the course of such a test, a check of the behavior, or the response, or the result of the operation of the application under certain conditions is carried out.  In this situation, you can use a spy to check whether, when a drop in the payment service was detected, a certain email was sent.  This, again, will be a test of the system’s behavior in a certain situation, which is probably fixed in the technical requirements for it, for example, in the following form: “Send an email to the administrator if the payment fails”.  On the other hand, if you use the mock object to represent the payment service and check the work when accessing it with the transfer of what it expects, then it will be about testing internal mechanisms that are not directly related to the functionality of the application, and quite perhaps they can change frequently. <br><br><h4>  Implications of derogation </h4><br>  With any refactoring code, you have to look for all the mocks, refactoring and their code.  As a result, support for tests will turn into a heavy burden, making them the enemies of the developer, and not his friends. <br><br><h4>  Wrong approach </h4><br>  This example shows a mock object that focuses on testing internal application mechanisms. <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">it(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"When a valid product is about to be deleted, ensure data access DAL was called once, with the right product and right config"</span></span>, <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">async</span></span> () =&gt; {   <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">//Предположим, что мы уже добавили товар   const dataAccessMock = sinon.mock(DAL);   //Это плохо, так как мы тут тестируем внутренние механизмы системы   dataAccessMock.expects("deleteProduct").once().withArgs(DBConfig, theProductWeJustAdded, true, false);   new ProductService().deletePrice(theProductWeJustAdded);   mock.verify(); });</span></span></code> </pre> <br><h4>  The right approach </h4><br>  Spies aim to test systems for compliance with their requirements, but, as a side effect, inevitably affect the internal mechanisms of the systems. <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">it(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"When a valid product is about to be deleted, ensure an email is sent"</span></span>, <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">async</span></span> () =&gt; {   <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">//Предположим, что мы уже добавили товар   const spy = sinon.spy(Emailer.prototype, "sendEmail");   new ProductService().deletePrice(theProductWeJustAdded);   //Это нормальный подход. Мы имеем дело с внутренними механизмами системы? Да, но лишь в виде побочного эффекта испытания системы на соответствие техническим требованиям к ней (отправка электронного письма) });</span></span></code> </pre> <br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">▍6.</font>  <font color="#3AC1EF">During testing, use realistic input, not limited to something like "foo"</font> </h3><br><h4>  Recommendations </h4><br>  Often, production errors occur under a very specific and even surprising set of circumstances.  This means that the closer to reality the input data used during testing, the higher the probability of early detection of errors.  Use, to generate data resembling real, specialized libraries, such as <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/faker">Faker</a> .  For example, such libraries generate random, but realistic phone numbers, user names, bank card numbers, company names, and even texts in the spirit of "lorem ipsum."  Moreover, consider using data from the production environment in tests.  If you want to raise such tests to an even higher level, refer to our next recommendation on testing, based on property testing. <br><br><h4>  Implications of derogation </h4><br>  When testing a project during its development, all tests can be passed only if they are carried out using unrealistic data, like foo lines.  But in production, the system will fail in a situation where a hacker will give her something like <code>@3e2ddsf . ##' 1 fdsfds . fds432 AAAA</code> <code>@3e2ddsf . ##' 1 fdsfds . fds432 AAAA</code>  <code>@3e2ddsf . ##' 1 fdsfds . fds432 AAAA</code> . <br><br><h4>  Wrong approach </h4><br>  The system successfully passes these tests only because they use unrealistic data. <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span></span> addProduct = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-function">(</span><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">name, price</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function">) =&gt;</span></span>{ <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span></span> productNameRegexNoSpace = <span class="hljs-regexp"><span class="hljs-regexp">/^\S*$/</span></span>;<span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">//пробелы запрещены if(!productNameRegexNoSpace.test(name))   return false;//Сюда мы, из-за нереалистичных входных данных, не доберёмся.     //Тут будет какой-то код   return true; }; it("Wrong: When adding new product with valid properties, get successful confirmation", async () =&gt; {   //Строка "Foo", используемая во всех тестах, не позволит проверить ситуацию, в которой возвращается false   const addProductResult = addProduct("Foo", 5);   expect(addProductResult).to.be.true;   //Ненадёжный результат: операция завершается успешно лишь из-за того, что мы   //не использовали в тесте длинные имена товаров с пробелами });</span></span></code> </pre> <br><h4>  The right approach </h4><br>  It uses randomized data, similar to the real ones. <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">it(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"Better: When adding new valid product, get successful confirmation"</span></span>, <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">async</span></span> () =&gt; {   <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span></span> addProductResult = addProduct(faker.commerce.productName(), faker.random.number());   <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">//Сгенерированы следующие входные данные: {'Sleek Cotton Computer',  85481}   expect(addProductResult).to.be.true;   //Тест не пройден, так как наши входные данные привели к срабатыванию механизма, нарушающего нормальную работу системы.   //Мы нашли ошибку на этапе разработки, а не в продакшне! });</span></span></code> </pre> <br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">▍7.</font>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Test systems using a variety of input data combinations using property-based testing.</font> </h3><br><h4>  Recommendations </h4><br>  Typically, tests use small sets of input data.  Even if they resemble real data (we talked about this in the previous section), such tests cover only a very limited number of possible combinations of the inputs of the entity under study.  For example, it might look like this: <code>(method('', true, 1), method("string" , false" , 0))</code> . The problem is that in the production API, which is called with five parameters, can get There are thousands of different variants of their combinations, one of which can lead to a crash (it is appropriate to recall <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3">fuzzing</a> .) What if you could write a single test that automatically checks a certain method for 1000 combinations of its inputs and finds out which ones it is does the method respond incorrectly? Testing based on checking properties is exactly what  us in such a situation is useful. Namely, in the course of this testing module checks, calling it with all possible combinations of input data, which increases the probability of finding a few bugs. Suppose we have a method <code>addNewProduct(id, name, isDiscount)</code> , and Library , performing the test, calls it with a variety of combinations of numeric, string and logical type parameters, for example - <code>(1, "iPhone", false)</code> , <code>(2, "Galaxy", true)</code> .  Testing based on property verification can be done using a common environment for executing tests (Mocha, Jest, and so on) and using specialized libraries like <a href="https://github.com/jsverify/jsverify">js-verify</a> or <a href="https://github.com/leebyron/testcheck-js">testcheck</a> (this library has very good documentation). <br><br><h4>  Implications of derogation </h4><br>  The developer, unknowingly, selects such test data that covers only those parts of the code that work correctly.  Unfortunately, this reduces the effectiveness of testing as a means to detect errors. <br><br><h4>  The right approach </h4><br>  Testing a variety of input options using the mocha-testcheck library. <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">require</span></span>(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'mocha-testcheck'</span></span>).install(); <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span></span> {expect} = <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">require</span></span>(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'chai'</span></span>); <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span></span> faker = <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">require</span></span>(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'faker'</span></span>); describe(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'Product service'</span></span>, () =&gt; { describe(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'Adding new'</span></span>, () =&gt; {   <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">//это выполнится 100 раз с использованием различных случайных свойств   check.it('Add new product with random yet valid properties, always successful',     gen.int, gen.string, (id, name) =&gt; {       expect(addNewProduct(id, name).status).to.equal('approved');     }); }) });</span></span></code> </pre> <br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">▍8.</font>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Aim to ensure that the test code is self-sufficient, minimizing external tools and abstractions</font> </h3><br><h4>  Recommendations </h4><br>  It is probably already obvious that I am a supporter of extremely simple tests.  The fact is that otherwise the development team of a certain project, in fact, has to deal with another project.  In order to understand its code, they have to spend valuable time, which they don’t have much.  <a href="https://mtlynch.io/good-developers-bad-tests/">It is</a> very well written about this phenomenon: “A quality production code is a well thought out code, and a quality test code is a code that is completely understandable ... When you write a test, think about who will see the error message displayed by him.  This person would not like, in order to understand the causes of the error, to read the code of the entire test suite or the inheritance tree code of the utilities used for testing. ” <br><br>  In order for the reader to understand the test without leaving its code, minimize the use of utilities, hooks, or any external mechanisms when performing a test.  If in order to do this, it is necessary to resort too often to copying and pasting operations, you can stop at one external auxiliary mechanism, the use of which does not violate the comprehensibility of the test.  But, if the number of such mechanisms will grow, the test code will lose clarity. <br><br><h4>  Implications of derogation </h4><br> Вы обнаружили, что в ваших тестах применяется 4 вспомогательных модуля, 2 из которых унаследованы от базовых утилит, много кода для настройки тестовой среды и несколько хуков? Принимайте поздравления! Теперь вам надо будет поддерживать ещё один непростой проект, а если всё и дальше будет продолжаться в том же духе, то вы скоро начнёте писать тесты для тестов. <br><br><h4> Неправильный подход </h4><br> Взгляните на эту интересную и запутанную структуру. Ясен ли вам смысл происходящего без обращения к коду внешних зависимостей? <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">test(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"When getting orders report, get the existing orders"</span></span>, () =&gt; {   <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span></span> queryObject = QueryHelpers.getQueryObject(config.DBInstanceURL);   <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span></span> reportConfiguration = ReportHelpers.getReportConfig();<span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">//Что это за конфигурация? Из кода теста это неясно   userHelpers.prepareQueryPermissions(reportConfiguration);//Что здесь происходит? Без внешних источников этого не понять   const result = queryObject.query(reportConfiguration);   assertThatReportIsValid();//Снова неясный момент, опять придётся уходить из кода теста и читать об этом где-то ещё   expect(result).to.be.an('array').that.does.include({id:1, productd:2, orderStatus:"approved"});   //откуда мы знаем о существовании этого заказа? придётся покинуть код теста и это выяснить })</span></span></code> </pre> <br><h4>  The right approach </h4><br> Вот пример теста, понять который можно без обращения к стороннему коду. <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">it(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"When getting orders report, get the existing orders"</span></span>, () =&gt; {   <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">//Хочется надеяться, что код этого текста понятен сам по себе   const orderWeJustAdded = ordersTestHelpers.addRandomNewOrder();   const queryObject = newQueryObject(config.DBInstanceURL, queryOptions.deep, useCache:false);   const result = queryObject.query(config.adminUserToken, reports.orders, pageSize:200);   expect(result).to.be.an('array').that.does.include(orderWeJustAdded); })</span></span></code> </pre> <br><h3> <font color="#3AC1EF">▍9. Избегайте использования глобальных настроек и заранее подготовленных данных: пусть каждый тест пользуется собственными данными</font> </h3><br><h4>  Recommendations </h4><br> Если следовать золотому правилу тестирования, изложенному в нулевом пункте этого материала, то каждый тест должен, например, самостоятельно добавлять в базу данных некие записи и пользоваться только ими. Это поможет предотвратить проблему связанности разных тестов и позволит легко анализировать ход выполнения отдельных тестов. В реальности тестировщики часто нарушают это правило, заполняя базы данных информацией до запуска тестов (это ещё называют настройкой <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_fixture">тестового окружения</a> ) ради улучшения производительности тестирования. Хотя производительность — это важно, проблемы производительности поддаются решению (взгляните на раздел, где речь идёт о компонентном тестировании). А вот вопросы сложности тестов — это уже гораздо серьёзнее, и именно ими и нужно, по большей части, руководствоваться, принимая различные решения. На практике это означает, что нужно сделать так, чтобы каждый тест в явном виде добавлял бы в базу данных необходимые ему записи и работал бы только с ними. Если на первый план выходит производительность — тогда можно найти разумный компромисс, скажем, централизованно готовя данные, с которыми будут работать только те тесты, которые эти данные не меняют (то есть только те, которые, например, выполняют к базам данных лишь запросы на чтение). <br><br><h4>  Implications of derogation </h4><br> Предположим, несколько тестов дало сбой. Развёртывание проекта отменено. Команде нужно будет потратить несколько часов на выяснение причин происходящего. Этими причинами могут быть ошибки в коде. На самом же деле оказывается, что сбои тестов вызваны тем, что некоторые из них меняют одни и те же заранее заданные данные, а другие об этом ничего не знают. <br><br><h4> Неправильный подход </h4><br> Тесты в этом примере не являются независимыми. Они полагаются на некий глобальный хук, пользуясь общей базой данных. <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">before(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> =&gt;</span></span> { <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">//добавляем сведения об объектах и администраторах в БД. Где находятся данные? Где-то снаружи, например - в некоем json-файле. await DB.AddSeedDataFromJson('seed.json'); }); it("When updating site name, get successful confirmation", async () =&gt; { //Мне известно, что объект, называемый "Portal", существует, так как я видел его в файле с начальными данными const siteToUpdate = await SiteService.getSiteByName("Portal"); const updateNameResult = await SiteService.changeName(siteToUpdate, "newName"); expect(updateNameResult).to.be(true); }); it("When querying by site name, get the right site", async () =&gt; { //Мне известно, что объект, называемый "Portal", существует, так как я видел его в файле с начальными данными const siteToCheck = await SiteService.getSiteByName("Portal"); expect(siteToCheck.name).to.be.equal("Portal"); //Сбой! Предыдущий тест поменял название объекта :[ });</span></span></code> </pre> <br><h4>  The right approach </h4><br> Мы можем не покидать пределы теста, организовав всё так, чтобы каждый тест работал бы с собственным набором данных. <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">it(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"When updating site name, get successful confirmation"</span></span>, <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">async</span></span> () =&gt; { <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">//тест добавляет в базу новые записи и работает только с ними const siteUnderTest = await SiteService.addSite({   name: "siteForUpdateTest" }); const updateNameResult = await SiteService.changeName(siteUnderTest, "newName"); expect(updateNameResult).to.be(true); });</span></span></code> </pre> <br><h3> <font color="#3AC1EF">▍10. Не перехватывайте в тесте исключения, возникающие в коде. Обрабатывайте их с помощью конструкции expect</font> </h3><br><h4>  Recommendations </h4><br> Если нужно проверить код на предмет выбрасывания им исключений, может показаться, что правильно будет использовать конструкцию <code>try-catch-finally</code> и проверить некое утверждение при входе в блок <code>catch</code> . Результат такого подхода, показанный ниже, выражается в виде неуклюжего и слишком длинного кода теста, читая который непросто понять цель теста и ожидаемый результат. <br><br> Более изящная альтернатива такому подходу заключается в использовании особого однострочного утверждения Chai, которое выглядит как <code>expect(method).to.throw</code> . Подобное есть и в Jest: <code>expect(method).toThrow()</code> . Используя подобные конструкции совершенно необходимо проверить свойство объекта ошибки, указывающее на её тип. В противном случае, если тип ошибок не проверять, тест просто покажет сообщение об ошибке без разъяснения его смысла. <br><br><h4>  Implications of derogation </h4><br> Если тесты обрабатывают все исключения, возникающие в коде, одинаково, из отчёта о тестировании может быть очень непросто понять причины неправильного поведения программы. <br><br><h4> Неправильный подход </h4><br> Вот длинный код теста, в котором сделана попытка проверки выдачи кодом исключений с помощью конструкции <code>try-catch</code> . <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">it(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"When no product name, it throws error 400"</span></span>, <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">async</span></span>() =&gt; { <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span></span> errorWeExceptFor = <span class="hljs-literal"><span class="hljs-literal">null</span></span>; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">try</span></span> { <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span></span> result = <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">await</span></span> addNewProduct({<span class="hljs-attr"><span class="hljs-attr">name</span></span>:<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'nest'</span></span>});} <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">catch</span></span> (error) { expect(error.code).to.equal(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'InvalidInput'</span></span>); errorWeExceptFor = error; } expect(errorWeExceptFor).not.to.be.null; <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">//Если это утверждение не выполнится, то в отчёте о проведении теста будет сказано //лишь о том, что некое значение равняется null, и ни слова о выброшенном исключении });</span></span></code> </pre> <br><h4>  The right approach </h4><br> Вот как использование конструкции <code>expect</code> позволяет написать тест, отчёт которого будет понятен даже специалисту, далёкому от работы с кодом приложения. <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">it.only(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"When no product name, it throws error 400"</span></span>, <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">async</span></span>() =&gt; { expect(addNewProduct)).to.eventually.throw(AppError).with.property(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'code'</span></span>, <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"InvalidInput"</span></span>); });</code> </pre> <br><h3> <font color="#3AC1EF">▍11. Назначайте тестам теги, указывающие на их особенности</font> </h3><br><h4>  Recommendations </h4><br> Разные тесты должны выполняться в различных ситуациях. Например, минимальный набор тестов для выявления очевидных ошибок (smoke test), не подразумевающий работу с подсистемами ввода-вывода, стоит запускать каждый раз, когда разработчик сохраняет или коммитит файл. А вот полное сквозное тестирование обычно выполняют при отправке нового пулл-запроса в репозиторий. Выбор тестов, которые должны выполняться в том или ином сценарии, можно организовать на основе назначаемых им тегов, представляющих собой ключевые слова наподобие <code>#cold</code> , <code>#api</code> , <code>#sanity</code> . В результате можно будет отбирать нужные тесты средствами используемой системы автоматического запуска тестов и выполнять в определённых ситуациях только их. Например, в Mocha для отбора тестов можно воспользоваться <a href="https://mochajs.org/">флагом</a> <code>-g</code> ( <code>--grep</code> ). <br><br><h4>  Implications of derogation </h4><br> Если представить себе, что каждый раз, когда разработчики вносят небольшое изменение в код, выполняется куча тестов, в ходе которых производятся десятки запросов к базе данных, то окажется, что проводиться это тестирование будет крайне медленно. В результате разработчики постараются от таких тестов избавиться. <br><br><h4>  The right approach </h4><br> Тег <code>#cold-test</code> позволяет системе запуска тестов отобрать только те из них, на выполнение которых много времени не требуется. В данном случае такой тег указывает на то, что тест работает быстро и не пользуется подсистемой ввода-вывода, а значит, вызывать его можно очень часто — буквально в процессе ввода кода разработчиком. <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">//этот тест очень быстр (в частности, не взаимодействует с БД), поэтому мы назначаем ему //соответствующий тег, что позволяет пользователю или системе выполнения тестов //вызывать его часто describe('Order service', function() { describe('Add new order #cold-test #sanity', function() {   it('Scenario - no currency was supplied. Expectation - Use the default currency #sanity', function() {     //какой-то код   }); }); });</span></span></code> </pre> <br><h3> <font color="#3AC1EF">▍12. Не забывайте о других правилах подготовки качественных тестов</font> </h3><br><h4>  Recommendations </h4><br> В этом материале даются рекомендации по тестированию, относящиеся к Node.js-проектам. Здесь же представлены рекомендации, широко известные, но непосредственно к Node.js не относящиеся. <br><br> Полезно изучить и опробовать принципы <a href="https://www.sm-cloud.com/book-review-test-driven-development-by-example-a-tldr/">TDD</a> — они весьма ценны во многих ситуациях, хотя вполне может оказаться так, что в ваш стиль работы над проектами они не вписываются. Это не должно вас расстраивать, так как подходят они далеко не всем. Рассмотрите возможность написания тестов до написания кода, для которого они предназначены, работая в стиле <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/12/17/TheCyclesOfTDD.html">Red-Green-Refactor</a> . Следите за тем, чтобы один тест проверял лишь что-то одно, а если вы обнаруживаете в программе ошибку, то, перед её исправлением, напишите тест для её выявления, что позволит находить такие же ошибки и в будущем. Следуйте правилу, в соответствии с которым рабочий код не пишут без неудачно завершившегося теста. Избегайте зависимостей тестов от среды выполнения программ (это — пути к файлам, операционная система, и так далее). <br><br><h4>  Implications of derogation </h4><br> Разработка через тестирование — это техника разработки ПО, которая вобрала в себя многие годы опыта. Неразумно полностью от всего этого отказываться. <br><br><h2> <font color="#3AC1EF">Раздел 2. Типы тестов</font> </h2><br><h3> <font color="#3AC1EF">▍13. Расширьте набор используемых вами методик тестирования, выйдя за пределы модульных тестов и пирамиды тестов</font> </h3><br><h4>  Recommendations </h4><br> Пирамида тестов, выделяющая три типа тестирования, хотя этой модели уже около 10 лет, всё ещё не потеряла актуальности. Она влияет на стратегии тестирования, применяемые большинством разработчиков. В то же время, в тени этой пирамиды скрывается немало современных методик тестирования. Учитывая серьёзнейшие изменения, произошедшие в мире разработки ПО за последнее десятилетие (микросервисы, облачные и бессерверные технологии), возможно ли, чтобы одна модель тестирования, уже довольно старая, подходила бы для всех приложений? Может быть миру тестирования стоит присмотреться к чему-то новому? <br><br> Пожалуйста, не поймите меня неправильно. Сегодня, в 2019 году, пирамида тестов, TDD, модульные тесты — это всё такие же мощные методики тестирования как и раньше, идеально подходящие для множества приложений. Только, как и в случае с любыми другими моделями, несмотря на их полезность, иногда некоторые модели тестирования <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong">не подходят</a> для решения определённых задач. Например, представьте себе IoT-приложение, которое, через шину сообщений, реализуемую с помощью чего-то вроде Kafka или RabbitMQ, получает множество сообщений о неких событиях. Затем эти данные попадают в какое-то хранилище, и, в итоге, оказываются в пользовательском интерфейсе для анализа данных. Нужно ли тратить половину бюджета, выделенного на тестирование, на написание модульных тестов для приложения, ядром которого являются задачи интеграции, и которое практически не содержит программной логики? С ростом разнообразия приложений (боты, работа с блокчейном, приложения для голосового помощника Alexa) растут и шансы того, что появятся сценарии, в которых пирамида тестов окажется не лучшим выбором. <br><br> Пришло время присмотреться к новым методикам тестирования, познакомиться с новыми типами тестов (о них мы поговорим ниже). При этом не стоит, конечно, забывать о пирамиде тестов и о других классических подходах к тестированию, но, подбирая подходящие тесты, нужно учитывать то, что происходит в реальном мире. Скажем, если оказалось, что что-то не так с API некоего проекта — можно взглянуть на шаблон Consumer-Driven Contracts и написать соответствующие тесты. Тесты стоит диверсифицировать, взяв пример с разумного инвестора, который, проанализировав риски, строит диверсифицированный инвестиционный портфель. Изучив проект, можно понять, в каких его частях могут возникнуть проблемы, выявить которые, используя некую методику тестирования, будет непросто. Найдя подобные участки проекта, можно подстраховаться, написав для них особые тесты. <br><br> Обратите внимание на то, что вокруг методологии TDD в мире разработки ПО идут постоянные разговоры. Одни говорят, что TDD нужно использовать всегда и везде, другие придерживаются прямо противоположной точки зрения. По поводу этих крайностей можно сказать лишь о том, что идеи, делящие мир исключительно на белое и чёрное, всегда ошибочны. <br><br><h4>  Implications of derogation </h4><br> Если разработчик не будет присматриваться к современным методикам тестирования — он может пропустить нечто весьма эффективное (вроде фаззинга), почти мгновенно оправдывающее усилия на его внедрение. <br><br><h4>  The right approach </h4><br> Здесь мы предложим вам пару полезных публикаций. Вот <a href="https://medium.com/%40copyconstruct/testing-microservices-the-sane-way-9bb31d158c16">материал</a> о тестировании микросервисов. Вот <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D-2zP494wdUY%26feature%3Dyoutu.be">видео</a> о том, что, в сфере Node.js, можно увидеть за границами модульных тестов. <br><br><h3> <font color="#3AC1EF">▍14. Возможно, вам стоит обратить внимание на компонентное тестирование</font> </h3><br><h4>  Recommendations </h4><br> Каждый модульный тест проверяет лишь небольшую часть приложения. Полное покрытие кода такими тестами — дорогое удовольствие. В то же время, сквозное тестирование легко покрывает большие объёмы кода, но оно не так надёжно и медленнее выполняется. Почему бы, выбирая подход к тестированию проекта, не остановиться на чём-то сбалансированном, и писать тесты, которые находятся где-то между модульными и сквозными? Найти такой подход можно, задействовав компонентные тесты. Они недооценены в современной разработке ПО, но они дают программисту лучшее из двух подходов к тестированию: высокую производительность с возможностью применения шаблонов TDD, а также — реалистичное и очень хорошее покрытие тестами кода. <br><br> Компонентные тесты направлены на микросервисный «модуль». Они работают с API, не создавая мок-объектов для чего бы то ни было, принадлежащего самому микросервису (например, речь идёт о работе с реальной базой данных, или, по крайней мере, с её копией, хранящейся в оперативной памяти). Они, вместо этого, создают стабы для всего, что находится за пределами модуля (скажем, сюда относятся обращения к другим микросервисам). Поступая так, мы тестируем именно то, что мы разворачиваем, всесторонне исследуем приложение и, в приемлемое время, получаем результаты, которым можно доверять. <br><br><h4>  Implications of derogation </h4><br> Пользуясь исключительно модульными тестами, можно, потратив долгие дни на их написание, обнаружить, что код покрыт тестами лишь процентов на 20. <br><br><h4>  The right approach </h4><br> Вот библиотека <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest">supertest</a> , которая позволяет тестировать API, созданные с использованием Express, делая это быстро и покрывая тестами множество уровней абстракции. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/286/bd8/02d/286bd802d29e7f6eb475567c97c9429d.png"></div><br> <i><font color="#999999">Тестирование API, разработанных средствами Express</font></i> <br><br><h3> <font color="#3AC1EF">▍15. Для того чтобы быть уверенным в том, что новые релизы проекта не нарушают работу API, используйте шаблон Consumer-Driven Contracts</font> </h3><br><h4>  Recommendations </h4><br> Предположим, с вашими микросервисами работает множество клиентов, и вы, из соображений совместимости, поддерживаете в рабочем состоянии несколько разных версий сервиса. Затем вы, в коде микросервиса, меняете какое-то поле, и некий важный клиент, который этим полем пользуется, оказывается из-за этого в глубокой печали. Это «уловка-22» мира интеграции: серверу очень сложно учесть ожидания множества клиентов. С другой стороны, клиент ничего протестировать не может, так как порядок релиза продукта контролируется сервером. Для того чтобы революционным образом преобразовать этот процесс, появился шаблон <a href="https://docs.pact.io/">Consumer-Driven Contracts и фреймворк PACT</a> . <br><br> Теперь не сервер определяет план собственного тестирования. Вместо этого тесты для сервера определяет клиент. Фреймворк PACT может записывать ожидания клиентов и помещать их туда, где они доступны серверу (отдавая их «брокеру»). Сервер может эти данные взять и проверять с их помощью код, при каждой сборке, с использованием библиотеки PACT, на предмет нарушенных контрактов, то есть ситуаций, в которых не выполняются ожидания клиента. В результате несовпадения между ожиданиями клиента и тем, что реально предоставляет сервер, выявляются очень рано, в ходе сборки проекта, что позволяет разработчику сэкономить время и нервы. <br><br><h4>  Implications of derogation </h4><br> Альтернативами вышеописанного подхода являются изнурительное ручное тестирование или страх развёртывания новой версии сервера. <br><br><h4>  The right approach </h4><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c39/0ef/dcd/c390efdcd01b24f5089bf7160fd5c5c6.png"></div><br> <i><font color="#999999">Шаблон Consumer-Driven Contracts</font></i> <br><br> На этапе разработки микросервис А, через брокера, сообщает микросервису B о том, чего он от него ждёт. Микросервис B это учитывает и система без проблем работает в продакшне. <br><br><h3> <font color="#3AC1EF">▍16. Тестируйте промежуточное ПО в изоляции</font> </h3><br><h4>  Recommendations </h4><br> Многие избегают тестировать промежуточное программное обеспечение (middleware) из-за того, что оно представляет собой лишь небольшую часть системы, и из-за того, что для этого нужен рабочий Express-сервер. И та и другая причины не выдерживают критики. Программы промежуточного слоя, хотя и выглядят скромно, влияют на все запросы или на большую их часть. Их можно легко протестировать, представив в виде чистых функций, которые принимают JS-объекты вида <code>{req,res}</code> . Для того чтобы протестировать подобную функцию, её нужно лишь вызвать и «пошпионить» (например, используя <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/sinon">Sinon</a> ) за тем, что она делает с объектами <code>{req,res}</code> . Сделав это, можно убедиться в том, что она работает правильно, или найти ошибки. Библиотека <a href="http">node-mock-http</a> идёт ещё дальше, и, вместе с наблюдением за поведением функций, ещё и позволяет работать с объектами запроса и ответа. Например, с её помощью можно проверить, соответствует ли ожиданиям HTTP-статус, установленный у объекта-ответа. <br><br><h4>  Implications of derogation </h4><br> Ошибка в промежуточном программном обеспечении Express означает неправильную обработку всех или большинства запросов. <br><br><h4>  The right approach </h4><br> Вот пример тестирования промежуточного ПО в изоляции без выполнения реальных сетевых вызовов и без задействования всего Express-сервера. <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">//Промежуточное ПО, которое мы хотим протестировать const unitUnderTest = require('./middleware') const httpMocks = require('node-mocks-http'); //Тут используется Jest, то же самое в Mocha реализуется с помощью describe() и it() test('A request without authentication header, should return http status 403', () =&gt; { const request = httpMocks.createRequest({   method: 'GET',   url: '/user/42',   headers: {     authentication: ''   } }); const response = httpMocks.createResponse(); unitUnderTest(request, response); expect(response.statusCode).toBe(403); });</span></span></code> </pre> <br><h3> <font color="#3AC1EF">▍17. Исследуйте код и выполняйте рефакторинг с использованием статических анализаторов</font> </h3><br><h4>  Recommendations </h4><br> Использование статических инструментов анализа кода полезно в том плане, что это позволяет получить объективные показатели качества кода, понять, в каком направлении его нужно улучшать, и, в результате, усовершенствовать код. Подобные инструменты можно настроить так, чтобы сборка проекта прерывалась бы в том случае, если они обнаруживают в нём что-то нехорошее. Главные преимущества таких инструментов, в сравнении с обычными линтерами, заключаются в том, что они могут исследовать качество кода в масштабах множества файлов (то есть, например, находить дублирующийся код), а также в том, что они умеют выполнять продвинутый анализ кода (например — анализировать его сложность) и учитывать историю работы над ошибками. Вот пара инструментов для статического анализа кода, которые вы можете испытать: <a href="https://www.sonarqube.org/">SonarQube</a> (более <a href="https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarqube">2600</a> звёзд на GitHub) и <a href="https://codeclimate.com/">Code Climate</a> (более <a href="https://github.com/codeclimate/codeclimate">1500</a> звёзд). <br><br><h4>  Implications of derogation </h4><br> В продуктах, код которых отличается низким качеством, всегда есть ошибки. Такой код может отличаться низкой производительностью. Эти проблемы не исправить ни за счёт использования новейших библиотек, ни за счёт наличия у таких продуктов уникальных возможностей. <br><br><h4>  The right approach </h4><br> Вот как выглядит работа с коммерческим анализатором кода Code Climate. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cae/1fe/d5c/cae1fed5caf16576b4001dfe0235820c.png"></div><br> <i><font color="#999999">Работа с Code Climate</font></i> <br><br><h3> <font color="#3AC1EF">▍18. Проверьте готовность проекта к хаосу, который может царить в среде Node.js</font> </h3><br><h4>  Recommendations </h4><br> Тестирование большинства программ заключается в проверке их логики, и того, как они работают с данными. Это может показаться странным, если учесть, что самые серьёзные проблемы, которых по-настоящему сложно избежать, связаны с инфраструктурой. Например, тестировали ли вы когда-нибудь ваше приложение на предмет выяснения того, что случится, если память, доступная процессу, окажется переполненной? А знаете, что произойдёт, если процесс неожиданно завершится? А как быть, если скорость некоего API снизится в два раза? <br><br> Для проверки работоспособности систем в случаях возникновения подобных неприятностей в Netflix были разработаны <a href="https://principlesofchaos.org/%3Flang%3DRUcontent">принципы хаос-инженерии</a> . Они нацелены на то, чтобы повысить уровень информированности сообщества разработчиков о проблемах, возникающих в условиях хаоса, на то, чтобы дать программистам фреймворки и инструменты для тестирования приложений на устойчивость к подобным проблемам. Например, вот один из известных инструментов хаос-инженерии — <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/chaosmonkey">Chaos Monkey</a> . Он случайным образом отключает серверы, что позволяет проверить устойчивость системы к таким сбоям, её способность нормально работать в подобных условиях, и её независимость от отдельно взятого сервера. Есть и похожий инструмент для Kubernetes — <a href="https://github.com/asobti/kube-monkey">kube-monkey</a> . Все эти средства работают на уровне хостинга или платформы, но что если вы хотите проверить ваш проект на устойчивость к хаотическим ошибкам в среде Node.js? Скажем, это могут быть необработанные исключения и неудачно завершённые промисы, а также ситуации, в которых достигается ограничение V8 в виде 1.7 Гб памяти. Сюда же относятся проверки пользовательского интерфейса в случаях частой блокировки цикла событий. Для выполнения подобных испытаний можете взглянуть на мой проект <a href="https://github.com/i0natan/node-chaos-monkey">node-chaos</a> , который пока пребывает в альфа-версии. <br><br><h4>  Implications of derogation </h4><br> От хаотических ошибок никто не застрахован, поэтому, не учитывая возможность их возникновения, вы рискуете столкнуться с ними в самый неожиданный момент. <br><br><h4>  The right approach </h4><br> Вот страница npm-пакета <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/chaos-monkey">chaos-monkey</a> , который позволяет проверять приложения на устойчивость к самым разным странностям среды Node.js. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d24/162/bdb/d24162bdb8c2c430f9163a7eda8c6c32.png"></div><br> <i><font color="#999999">Пакет chaos-monkey</font></i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Results</font> </h2><br> Сегодня мы привели вашему вниманию почти два десятка советов, касающихся тестирования Node.js-проектов. В частности, мы поговорили об анатомии тестов и о типах тестов. В следующий раз поговорим об оценке эффективности тестов и об анализе качества кода. <br><br>  <b>Dear readers!</b> Используете ли вы принципы хаос-инженерии при тестировании своих проектов? <br><br> <a href="https://ruvds.com/ru-rub/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ba/550/d25/1ba550d25e8846ce8805de564da6aa63.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/435462/">https://habr.com/ru/post/435462/</a></p>
