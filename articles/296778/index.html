This list was compiled by analysts UBI Global, which is the undisputed leader in analyzing the effectiveness of business incubators worldwide.  Information about a pleasant event for St. Petersburg accelerator <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ubiglobal/photos/pb.887293314679197.-2207520000.1448543745./962610317147496/%3Ftype%3D3%26theate">appeared</a> on the UBI Global page on Facebook. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Recall that in October of this year, iDealMachine was recognized as one of the best accelerators in Europe, taking third place.  Then the analysis was also carried out by experts from UBI Global.  The Russian venture fund and start-up accelerator iDealMachine was founded quite recently - in 2012.  His office is located in St. Petersburg.  The sphere of interest of the organization is the IT industry.  The site iDealMachine indicated that the accelerator is currently working with 23 companies. <br><br>  In the selection of candidates and data analysis during the last benchmarking, several dozen experts from different countries participated.  In total, more than 1300 accelerators and incubators operating in the global market were assessed and compared.  For evaluating organizations, experts used more than 50 performance indicators.  One of the criteria was a contribution to the development of the competence of start-ups in the region, a positive impact on the local ecosystem, access to investments, and so on. <br><br>  The Canadian accelerator was recognized as the best. Entrepreneuriat laval was born in the French province of Canada - Quebec, which is ranked first, followed by the Irish NDRC, which invests mainly in technology companies, third place was given to overseas MassChallenge, which operates in the US, fourth - the Belgian organization iMinds, which was originally founded as a research institute. <br><br>  In addition to the above organizations, the top 10 also includes: the Italian incubator for business Knowbel Incubator, the Taiwanese Center of Industry Accelerator and Patent Strategy (which, by the way, ranked third among the best incubators and accelerators of the Asia-Pacific region), the Australian Melbourne Accelerator Program , Mexican ITESM Accelerator Network and Kenyan M: lab East. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296778/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296778/</a></p>
