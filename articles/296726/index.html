  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Microsoft obtained a major cloud services partner by entering into an agreement with Hewlett Packard Enterprise</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/95a/3d0/5d2/95a3d05d2546440e8d4de65392eb57d1.jpg"><br><br>  Microsoft can celebrate victory over a major competitor in cloud wars through a peace agreement.  Hewlett Packard Enterprise will soon provide its customers with new services of Microsoft Azure public cloud infrastructure. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This is a very important change, as HP had previously worked on developing its own cloud service.  However, last month, representatives of the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise reported that the company intends to abandon this undertaking.  Recall that only last month was the restructuring of the company Hewlett Packard, which was announced last fall.  As a result, two independent companies emerged: Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE) and HP Inc. <br><br>  Today, CEO Meg Whitman <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/11/24/microsoft-just-scored-a-big-new-cloud-partner-hewlett-packard-enterprise/">spoke</a> briefly about the new partnership between HP and Microsoft, which will affect not only the public, but also the hybrid cloud.  More details about him can be found at Discover, which will be held next week in London - the event will last three days (from 1 to 3 December). <br><br>  Margaret Whitman argues that a strategic agreement was reached between the companies, as both technology giants have a similar vision of hybrid technologies for business, and also see their cooperation as an opportunity to simplify the hybrid infrastructure for greater user convenience. <br><br>  Together, Microsoft and Hewlett Packard Enterprise can try to challenge Amazon, which is the undisputed leader in this segment.  Amazon Web Services, which has been providing cloud computing services to customers for nearly a decade, currently generates more than $ 2 billion in revenue over one quarter.  However, recently, Amazon‚Äôs potential competitors realized that they could not keep up with the leader alone, so they began to combine their efforts.  For example, Red Hat and Microsoft are now partners working on cloud services, and Dell, thinking over its own cloud, acquired EMC for $ 67 billion, thus concluding the biggest deal in the IT industry. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296726/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296726/</a></p>
