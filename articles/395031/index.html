  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dell comes to the aid of the creators of the cartoon</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the middle of May, the animated film ‚ÄúAngry Birds in the Cinema‚Äù, based on the popular video game series from Rovio Entertainment, was released in Russia.  The cartoon received a lot of positive feedback; it was warmly received by both children and adults.  Perhaps the success of the picture lies in the plot or in the original characters of the characters (which is worth only one Red bird, which learns to control their hot temper), but in our opinion, ‚ÄúAngry Birds in the cinema‚Äù would not have turned out so without painstaking work of artists and animators. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/802/93b/4c7/80293b4c7e7d4ad7a684a15d69407059.png"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The adaptation of the popular video game is a very complicated and long process.  When creating the film, Sony Pictures Imageworks involved more than 300 professionals who were faced with many difficult tasks.  Imagine, they should draw 130 species of birds, work out the movement of each feather, build lively landscapes with rustling leaves on trees, cool ponds and realistic explosions.  To create a whole cartoon world, it was necessary to calculate and render a lot of models. <br><br>  Dell is proud to have had a hand in such a large-scale project.  The Sony Pictures Imageworks team used about a thousand <a href="http://www.dell.com/ru/business/p/workstations">Dell Precision</a> computers in their work.  These are modern powerful workstations that are capable of performing the most complex tasks.  For example, the rendering process involved as many as 40,000 cores!  Another project partner was NVIDIA, which provided professional <a href="http://www.nvidia.ru/object/workstation-graphics-ru.html">NVIDIA Quadro M6000 24 GB, M4000 and K2200 graphics cards</a> .  The NVIDIA Quadro series of graphics adapters has been specifically designed to perform complex creative tasks. <br><br>  Computing technologies and infrastructure allowed three teams, working remotely from Southern California and Vancouver, to access shared data via PCoIP in real time.  PCoIP technology allows you to view and edit data stored on Dell Precision workstations from any compatible PC or tablet based on Windows.  For this, a PCoIP solution based on the Teradici Tera2 chip is installed in workstations.  The system provides not only convenient, but also completely secure access to shared data and is accompanied by free round-the-clock technical support. <br><br>  And now a few impressive facts that will help illustrate the complexity of the work on the creation of an animated film.  Imagine that rendering a 30-second movie on an ordinary PC would take 18 years, while the workflow can be compared with the daily streaming of the full-length picture.  But Dell Precision computers allowed us to spend a minimum amount of time on routine tasks and create more variants of the same scene, which in the end only slightly affected the duration of the work.  Sony Pictures Imageworks has never had such an experience before.  As a result, the picture, according to the creators themselves, surpassed all expectations.  Using high-performance technologies certified for working with professional applications and complex graphics, developers were able to concentrate on the creative process and implement the most daring ideas. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1fe/1b8/f63/1fe1b8f631bb4fe6993e4e451bc5b9f5.png"></div><br>  Modern workstations with powerful graphics give creators of animated films more leeway.  There is no longer any need to save resources, waste time waiting for the machine to finish rendering, and you can start working on the following frames.  All processes occur as quickly as possible, without hindering creativity and opening up a wide field for experimentation.  We at the Dell team are pleased to have helped create such a technically perfect job. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395031/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395031/</a></p>
