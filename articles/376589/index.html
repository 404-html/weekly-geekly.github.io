Of course, we are talking not only about the desktop computer, but also about various technological devices that contribute to the improvement of the quality of education.  So what devices are used by teachers in modern schools? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Interactive Whiteboards</b> <br>  Thanks to interactive whiteboards, you can add images, videos or presentations to an explanation of a new material.  The image on the interactive whiteboard is transmitted from the desktop computer using a projector. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2cc/e9b/5a2/2cce9b5a2f6225ec1252d1de885b3e36.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Electronic textbooks</b> <br>  In 2015, every Russian textbook should have an electronic version.  Special devices will show illustrations, interactive maps, videos and supporting materials for convenient lab work on most subjects.  Studies have shown that with age, students lose interest in reading traditional textbooks, and therefore - abandon their studies.  Today in Russia, the program for the development of electronic textbooks operates in seven regions.  Also, this innovation greatly facilitates the school backpack, because a modern tablet contains a whole library, and you can install it on any device, be it a computer, tablet or smartphone. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/317/f62/80e/317f6280e87aa06de176f592e234c147.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Electronic diaries and journals</b> <br>  <a href="https://www.shkolnaya-karta.ru/journal_teachers">Electronic journal</a> helps not only to optimize the work of the teacher, but also to establish communication between the school, students and their parents.  With the help of such journals, a teacher, by setting a grade, instantly places this result on the network, where it becomes available to both the parents of the child and the school administration.  Also, an electronic journal helps with scheduling and preparing reporting documents.  36% of Moscow schools have completely abandoned paper magazines and diaries. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/25b/fe0/bba/25bfe0bbab8aa4cb976815ff746584d7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Turnstile systems</b> <br>  Many schools have an e-pass system: parents receive an SMS when children find themselves behind turnstiles.  This innovation has a positive effect on the attendance of children, and subsequently - on their performance. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/48b/f15/bbe/48bf15bbed103599574fea97dcbf8d7d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Mobile applications</b> <br>  The rapid progress in the field of mobile technology has led to the fact that 70% of all mobile phones in the world are smartphones, which made mobile applications almost an integral part of people's lives.  The continuous involvement of students in the educational process is facilitated by specially designed mobile applications for schoolchildren and teachers that are available to them anytime and anywhere.  Such applications are good to use for continuous communication both between students and between students and the teacher.  These platforms are simply indispensable, for example, during the holidays. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/54c/36a/9cd/54c36a9cd271fba0e7dde4c5ca4b61bb.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In turn <a href="https://www.shkolnaya-karta.ru/">, Smiles.School Card</a> offers the introduction of the <a href="https://www.shkolnaya-karta.ru/journal_teachers">Electronic Journal and Diary</a> module, which is designed to make life easier for parents who can track all their children's progress online, and for teachers who will significantly reduce the time spent filling out paper documentation and will be able to devote this time to children. <br>  We also created a <a href="https://www.shkolnaya-karta.ru/app">unique Shkolnik app</a> that allows children to share educational materials and help each other in learning. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/376589/">https://habr.com/ru/post/376589/</a></p>
