According to the head of the corporation Tim Cook, the closing fiscal year is the most successful in the entire history of Apple, RBC <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/28/10/2015/562fef469a794763db4c4829">writes</a> .  The company's annual revenue increased immediately by 28%, reaching $ 234 billion. <br><br>  ‚ÄúFiscal year 2015 was the most successful year in Apple‚Äôs history; annual revenue grew by 28% and reached almost $ 234 billion. This success was made possible by our commitment to creating the best and most advanced products in the world, which is a testament to the grandiose skill of our team, - stated Cook. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to Cook, Apple now has the best product line ever.  These include iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, Apple Watch, iPad Pro and updated Apple TV, which shipments start this week. <br><br>  The fourth quarter of this year ended on September 26th.  The company's revenue for the last quarter was $ 51.5 billion, while its net profit was $ 11.1 billion. Based on one share, $ 1.96 is received.  Last year, Apple received revenue of $ 42.1 billion, and net quarterly profit of $ 8.5 billion. <br><br>  Over the last quarter, the corporation sold about 48 million iPhones, which coincided with analysts' expectations.  Nevertheless, the profit indicator exceeded forecasts.  About two-thirds of the income the corporation received through the sale of smartphones.  As for the tablets, the company recorded a 20 percent drop in their sales. <br><br>  Interestingly, before the publication of financial results, the value of the company's shares fell by 0.6%, but after the results became known, the stock price rose by 2.8%, to the level of $ 116.89. <br><br>  Current shareholders of the corporation will receive dividends of $ 0.52. <br><br>  As for the further results, here the opinions of experts are divided.  Some experts believe that without a new product, the company will not be able to grow further.  Other experts argue that Apple will be able to increase its presence in the market, plus gain additional profits through its Apple Music and Apple Pay services. <br><br>  The company has achieved great success in China.  So, in the fourth quarter, Apple's revenue exceeded last year's figure by 99% (from $ 6.29 billion to $ 12.51 billion).  The volume of Chinese sales for Apple exceeded the volume of the European market ($ 10.57 billion).  The main market is still the United States. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295772/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295772/</a></p>
