At one time we <a href="https://habr.com/company/intel/blog/274379/">wrote a lot</a> about the fact that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãseparating Habrahabr does not seem successful to us and we are immensely glad that common sense has finally triumphed.  In addition, the year was rich in memorable dates and memories - this was a little brightened by the lack of important news. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first words, as promised in the <a href="https://habr.com/company/intel/blog/434264/">post earlier</a> , recall the glorious jubilee - the 50th anniversary of Intel, which we celebrated in July.  In commemoration of this event, we published a whole series of articles devoted to <a href="https://habr.com/company/intel/blog/417517/">key moments</a> of the company's history, and also conducted a quiz on knowledge of little-known details of her biography.  Other historical and technological aspects related to Intel were also affected;  for example, the <a href="https://habr.com/company/intel/blog/418493/">first steps of Bluetooth technology</a> . <br><br>  Speaking of the blog‚Äôs educational mission, we‚Äôll recall the <a href="https://habr.com/company/intel/blog/358118/">practical AI</a> series of articles for us: an abridged Russian translation totaled 11 issues, and in the English original - all 23. We received different opinions on this material, but one thing that ours the translation was read a total of almost 70 thousand times, does not allow to consider its publication useless.  Well, let's also mention the heroic work of translation and layout - when will you still be able to praise yourself? <br><br>  And now - <s>slides</s> blog statistics for the past year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/94/qn/eg/94qneggpebgrd99hlx6pd1qkxfa.png"><br><br>  C - stability.  By quantitative indicators, we played a year at the level of the past.  I would like to continue to remain at this level, we will try to hold on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fn/s-/q4/fns-q4autbmrj0sxt-o1fjr__uu.png"><br><br>  On the qualitative side, we continue to suffer from a sharp reduction in the number of authors - employees of Intel, who brought us exclusive materials and rating.  Well, this is the reality in which we have to live. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ub/sr/6o/ubsr6oedhizd56al99b97mzcfnc.png"><br><br>  And now - our annual hit parade. <br><ul><li>  <i>Most rated post <b>(+90)</b> and most commented post <b>(105)</b></i> - <a href="https://habr.com/company/intel/blog/351406/">Arrays, pointers and other quantum phenomena around us</a> , by <a href="https://habr.com/users/vikky13/" class="user_link">vikky13</a> .  New hit from the honored author of best-sellers of our blog. </li><li>  <i>Post with the maximum number of views <b>(30.1k)</b></i> - <a href="https://habr.com/company/intel/blog/352420/">New microarchitecture of Intel processors: fast, but not free</a> , by <a href="https://habr.com/users/vikky13/" class="user_link">vikky13</a> .  Again in this nomination the April Fools' post won, and the other, which was released on the same day, took second place </li><li>  <i>The most added post to favorites <b>(193)</b></i> - <a href="https://habr.com/company/intel/blog/415811/">AI, practical course.</a>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/intel/blog/415811/">A review of neural networks for image classification</a> by <a href="https://habr.com/users/saul/" class="user_link">saul</a> .  Another proof that we knowingly publish translations from English articles of the authors of Intel. </li></ul><br>  In the next section of the article, we need to talk about the blog's plans for the next year, but so far, frankly, speaking, there are no special ones.  Except for one, the most important thing: we plan to make every effort to continue to inform you about the life and news of Intel.  Well, under the Christmas tree, we would gladly find a beautifully wrapped opportunity to realize these efforts. <br><br>  Happy New Year to all - 9 thousand followers of our blog! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/434670/">https://habr.com/ru/post/434670/</a></p>
