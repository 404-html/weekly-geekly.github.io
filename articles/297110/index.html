  <section class="page js-page"><h1>In spite of records: the love of investors and outstanding results do not save AirBnB and Uber from repression</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The <a href="https://www.airbnb.ru/">AirBnB</a> online rental and rental <a href="https://www.airbnb.ru/">service has</a> finally completed ‚Äúpaper-based‚Äù procedures for <a href="https://www.airbnb.ru/">applying</a> for a $ 1.5 billion round of financing at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  In June, the unprecedented amount of investments allowed the company not only to boast a new record, which no one else (at that time) had broken, but also seriously raised the start-up rating. <br><br>  The round led the <a href="http://www.generalatlantic.com/">General Atlantic</a> American hedge fund.  The investors of the project were also the first Chinese companies <a href="http://hillhousecap.com/">Hillhouse Capital</a> and <a href="http://www.tiger-global.co.uk/">Tiger Global</a> .  The previous round of AirBnB held in October last year.  Then she received a valuation of $ 10 billion. <br><br>  Now, however, it became <a href="http://www.forbes.ru/news/307523-investory-povysili-otsenku-uber-do-68-mlrd">known</a> that the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber">Uber</a> mobile taxi call service attracted $ 2.1 billion of investment in the next round of financing.  Uber's valuation exceeded $ 62.5 billion. <br><br>  Nevertheless, AirBnB has become one of the most expensive startups in the world. <a name="habracut"></a>  In June, Megamind <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/16862/">wrote</a> that the AirBnB service completes the next round of funding.  The company's valuation reached $ 25.5 billion.  Thus, AirBnB ranks third in capitalization after Uber (more than $ 62.5 billion) and Xiaomi ($ 46 billion). <br><br>  In official documents, AirBnB did not publish data on its revenue.  However, The Wall Street Journal, citing one investor, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/airbnb-raises-over-100-million-as-it-touts-strong-growth-1448049815">reports</a> that third-quarter revenue was $ 340 million.  At the same time, revenues from orders exceeded $ 2.2 billion.  The company's revenue this year reached $ 900 million.  This is three times more than in 2013. <br><br>  AirBnB officially confirmed the deal and conducted the necessary procedures at the SEC.  But the procedures and proceedings with some other organizations, apparently, still to come.  They are not ready to give AirBnB their blessing, because in the company's business, not everything is done ‚Äúofficially‚Äù and in accordance with the law.  At least, the authorities in New York City think so. <br><br>  New York Mayor Bill DeBlasio intends to submit to the City Council a bill prohibiting homeowners or tenants with a one-year or two-year lease to rent their apartments for less than 30 days. <br><br>  According to the city authorities, the hotel business in New York began to collapse in 2008 with the advent of the Internet service AirBnB.  In New York, they immediately experienced multimillion-dollar losses and outlawed AirBnB.  But so far they have not managed to limit the company's activities. <br><br>  In this sense, you can draw a parallel with Uber.  By the way, a major trial with a taxi service also took place in New York.  Moreover, DeBlasio is preparing new tests for Uber, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/12/4/9851000/uber-nyc-bill-de-blasio-report-investigation-cap-tax-cuomo">writes</a> The Verge.  Until the end of the month, it will form new proposals on the regulation of online transportation services. <br><br>  Nevertheless, investors are supportive of both companies and, as we see, invest enormous amounts. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297110/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297110/</a></p>
