The fact that they must be physically healthy and be experts in their fields is a matter of course.  But the space agency is committed to ensuring that people who will be sent to Mars in 20 years correspond to a certain psychological type.  For this NASA has allocated the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A3%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582_%25D0%2594%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25A5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0">University.</a>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A3%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582_%25D0%2594%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25A5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0">Johns Hopkins</a> research money, <a href="http://us.blastingnews.com/opinion/2016/02/nasa-is-already-studying-what-sort-of-person-is-best-suited-for-the-journey-to-mars-00788983.html">reports blastingnews.com</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A person who will be in close proximity with three to five other people for several years can not be an introvert that requires a lot of personal space for itself.  Nor will this man be an extrovert, eager for constant social interaction.  He should be able to work in a team, because the crew may consist of representatives of different cultures, since, most likely, the first flight to Mars will be international. <br><br>  Since it is not yet possible to evaluate and test candidates for a flight to Mars, the university will recruit surgeons and resuscitators to study how they behave in stressful situations.  The study will be supplemented by a similar project, which will hold the University.  William Rice (Houston, Texas). <br><br>  The dangers that the first humans will face on Mars are the consequences of microgravity and radiation, both during the flight itself and on the surface of the Red Planet. <br><br>  NASA and other structures, such as the US military, studied what was happening with groups of people in isolation through direct contact with each other.  The study of the behavior of scientists who spend months at bases in Antarctica, nuclear submarine crews, volunteers participating in the imitation of flights to Mars, and, of course, astronauts at the International Space Station contributed to the collection of necessary information. <br><br>  But the people who fly to Mars will be the only representatives of their own species.  The message from the surface of Mars will go to Earth for about 20 minutes, and the same back.  The crew should be not only at the peak of their physical form, but psychologically stable, because for a long time they will have to deal with boredom during the flight and deal with possible force majeure situations. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390659/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390659/</a></p>
