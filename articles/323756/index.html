  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to get the maximum discount when buying IT equipment</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In short, then find an adequate integrator and get him to work properly on solving your problem (ie, project), but in no case do everything yourself. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  You need to understand that the manufacturer gives discounts not to the customer, but to the reseller, i.e.  integrator, for a particular project.  And the more the integrator will work on the project, the more reason and arguments he has <s>to demand</s> to ask the manufacturer for the greatest possible discount, and the manufacturer‚Äôs desire to provide it.  The integrator, in turn, is, as a rule, ready to share its discount with the client (here, please, no need to think, meaning a discount for the customer company). <br><br>  Quite often you come across a situation where the client thinks just the opposite.  I will now do everything myself - I will develop a technical solution myself, I will make the specification myself, and even I will directly contact the manufacturer, and then I will definitely be given the best prices.  So, they will not give them, they simply have nothing to give, because the value of such a transaction for the manufacturer tends to zero.  Moreover, you will force the manufacturer to work on what you yourself have done, since any manufacturer is interested not only in money, but also in reputation, and in the case that the integrator did not work on the project, then the project‚Äôs performance and correctness Specifications are the responsibility of the manufacturer. <br><br>  Sometimes, the customer tries to become a reseller of one or another manufacturer and get the appropriate authorization.  If you are not a Sberbank, Facebook or Orange company, then, first, such ‚Äúpseudo-integrators‚Äù, as a rule, are perceived by a normal manufacturer accordingly, i.e.  yet they understand that the market will not develop such a ‚Äúreseller‚Äù and, that its only goal, is to get the best price for a loved one, that is,  either the manufacturer simply refuses the partnership, or, as they say, out of respect, will give a minimum level of authorization, assuming minimal discounts and any more or less honest integrator will be able to give the best prices during normal work on the project, since almost always the prices are determined in this case individually for each project.  And secondly, it is all the same the situation when the client did everything himself, what was already said. <br><br>  The third and possibly the most common situation is when at the procurement stage the customer sends out a specification to all possible suppliers, developed by some single integrator, hoping to create competition and thereby reduce the price.  It works, but only in the case when it comes to cheap equipment that is in high demand and, as they say, in the buyer's market.  Let me explain by example.  The sale of cheap consumer goods with mass demand is always the buyer's market, where exactly the buyer dictates the price, since, as a rule, in this case, the supply significantly exceeds the demand and there are a lot of producers of the goods.  For example, such a situation with non-exclusive food or household goods.  But everything changes in the case of a limited number of manufacturers of a product or the individual selection of goods for a specific task or project.  There is already a seller's market, where exactly the manufacturer dictates the price.  For example, in the case of selling cars, no matter what salon you come in, the prices for the same model will most likely be about the same.  But in the case of the automotive market, at least, all configurations, as a rule, differ by several dozen different options.  The sale of complex telecommunications equipment is not enough that the market for manufacturers is rather narrow, and the choice of specification can also come from hundreds or thousands of different commodity items.  So, again, given that the prices are issued by the manufacturer individually for a specific project and the integrator, this approach is not an effective tool to reduce prices.  In my experience, rather the dense work of the customer with the integrator as with a partner, and not as a counterparty, gives a much greater gain both in terms of obtaining the minimum project cost, and in terms of project success from an engineering point of view. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/323756/">https://habr.com/ru/post/323756/</a></p>
