A point domain is just another domain, and it implements the same mechanism.  So the dot and dot com domains nowadays use the SEC DNS, and there are all these records that say, for example, that .in is a domain name that exists, and the dot name also exists, and there is nothing more between them.  So in the top level domains there are all these things. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2u/gs/44/2ugs448d0swpqq4xpdcq7qrzo5e.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Student:</b> Aside from the danger of DoS attacks, why do we care so much about repeating domain names within mit.edu? <br><br>  <b>Professor: I</b> don’t know for sure.  Anyway, AFS has a text file that lists all of these MIT domain names.  But I think that in general, some companies feel a little embarrassed in this sense, because they often have internal names that are in the DNS and that cannot be given to outsiders.  I think that in fact, this is a fuzzy area that has never been formalized and which does not clarify exactly what guarantees the DNS provides to users.  Usually people assume that if there is a confidential name, then in the case of DNS it will not be disclosed. <br><br>  I think this is another place where this system does not have a clear specification in terms of what it should or should not provide. <br><br>  <b>Student:</b> Is it possible to establish the validity of a signature, highlighting it in some way? <br><br>  <b>Professor:</b> these things have a validity period, for example, you can sign that the given set of names is valid for a week, and then customers, if they have a synchronized clock, can reject old signed messages. <br><br>  So, we can assume that we have discussed attacks by guessing the sequence numbers of TCP SYN.  Another interesting problem that concerns TCP is the DDoS attack, which exploits the fact that the server retains some state.  If you look at this handshake that was drawn on the board earlier, you will see that when a client establishes a connection with the server, the server must remember the sequence number of the client SNc.  Thus, the server must support some data structure in a separate block, which indicates that this sequence number is used for this connection. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lf/_t/al/lf_tald10iu_psgepzhjfretcr0.jpeg"><br><br>  This is a kind of table where the serial number of the SN is stored and the fact that the client-server connection has the serial number of the SNc.  The reason why the server should store this table is that the server must find out which correct value the SNc sequence number should accept later, for example, SNc + 1.  In addition, the server also needs to store SNs numbers, which are much more important because they show the server that the connection is established with the "right guy." <br><br>  The problem is that this table has no real border.  This way, you can get packets from some machine without even knowing who is sending them.  You simply receive a packet that looks like C-&gt; S with the source address, which states that it is C. In order to potentially accept this connection from this IP address, you need to create an entry in the table.  Moreover, these records exist for a long time, because perhaps someone establishes a connection with you from a very distant place and at the same time many packets are lost.  In the worst case, it may take, for example, a minute until someone finishes this TCP handshake.  So you have to store this state on the TCP stack for a relatively long time, and there is no way to guess whether it will be valid or not. <br><br>  Thus, the most common DoS attack against most TCP stacks that people have invented is the simple transfer of a large number of packets.  If I’m an attacker, I’ll just send a huge number of SYN packets to a specific server and force it to overflow this table. <br><br>  The problem is that at best, the attacker simply uses the same source IP address.  In this case, you can simply say that each client is only allowed two entries, or something like that.  And then the attacker can use a maximum of 2 two entries in the table. <br><br>  The problem, of course, is that an attacker can fake clients' IP addresses, make them look random.  Then it will be very difficult for the server to distinguish who is trying to establish a connection with it - an attacker or some kind of client that the server has never heard of before. <br><br>  So, if you look at a site that should accept connections from anywhere in the world, this will be a big problem.  Because either you are denying access to everyone, or you must be able to store state for most fake connection attempts. <br><br>  So this is a problem both for TCP and for most protocols, which allow some kind of connection initiation, in which the server must save state.  But there are some fixes implemented in TCP, which we'll talk about in a second, and they will try to deal with this problem, which is called SYN Flooding in TCP. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ds/iv/2l/dsiv2l98atlrnyqwfzc3pg2-jma.jpeg"><br><br>  In general, this is a problem that you should know about and try to avoid in any protocol that you are developing.  You must specify that the server does not have to keep state until it can authenticate and identify the client.  Because only after checking the client’s authenticity can one decide whether he is allowed to connect, for example, only once, in which case the server does not need to save the state for this connection. <br><br>  The problem is that you guarantee the preservation of the state even before you find out who is connecting to you.  Let's take a look at how to counteract the SYN Flooding flood attack, which is that the server accumulates too much state. <br><br>  You could change TCP again, for example, fix it quite easily with cryptography or something else, or change what is responsible for maintaining a state.  But the fact is, we need to use TCP as it is.  Could we solve this problem without changing the existing TCP protocol? <br><br>  This, again, is an exercise in trying to figure out exactly which tricks we could perform, or more precisely, which assumptions we could leave alone and still stick to the existing TCP header format when working with them. <br><br>  And the trick is to find a smart way to make a server stateless, so that it does not have to store this table in memory.  This can be done by carefully selecting the SNs, that is, instead of the formula we considered earlier and where we should have added this function, we will choose the sequence numbers in a completely different way.  I will give you the exact formula, and then we will talk about why it is really interesting and what good properties it has. <br><br>  If the server detects that it is under attack of this kind, then it goes into a mode where it selects SNs using a formula with the same function F as we’ve considered before. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ai/u5/2u/aiu52uoadhfflnvhgntwy_bedju.jpeg"><br><br>  This function has the source IP address, the destination IP address, the same things as before — the source port, the destination port, the timestamp, and the key.  And we are going to combine this function with a timestamp rather “coarse-grained”, the size of a few minutes.  There is a separation between these two parts of the header — a function and a time stamp that does not need a lot of bits.  I forgot exactly how this protocol works on a real computer, but you can imagine that the timestamp takes up 8 bits, and the rest of the sequence number formula is 24 bits. <br><br>  So why is this a good plan?  What is going on here at all?  Why do we need this strange formula?  You have to remember that we tried to get from the sequence numbers.  Two things happen here. <br><br>  The first is protection against duplicate packets.  There is a diagram with an old-style ordinal on the board, to which we add a function to prevent duplication of packets from previous connections. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sw/06/2g/sw062gymfw2nxnff7rciprvtjsy.jpeg"><br><br>  It turns out that people could not find a better way to defend against SYN Flooding attacks, except to use this action plan, which works well in some situations.  It was one plan, but another plan - a function with a timestamp, where we abandoned this component of the old style.  Instead, we will focus on making sure that if someone provides this ACK (SNs) sequence number in response to a packet, that someone will be the “right” client. <br><br>  You remember that to prevent IP spoofing attacks, we kind of rely on this value (SNs).  After all, if the server sends the SNs value to the client in the second step, we expect that only this client will be able to send us the corrected SNs value back in the third step, completing the connection setup. <br><br>  That is why you had to keep this sequence number in the table, because otherwise, how would you know if this is a real answer or a fake?  The reason for using this function F is that now we can not save this table in memory. <br><br>  Instead, when a connection attempt is made, shown in the first step, in the second step we calculate the SNs using this formula and simply send it back to the client who wants to contact us, after which we forget about this connection. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u7/uh/ml/u7uhml0zefpx1udtmt4j5xnaqxw.jpeg"><br><br>  Then, when the third packet arrives and its value (SNs) matches what we expect to see, it means someone received our answer in the second step and finally sent it to us.  Finally, after this third step, we can put the real entry for this TCP connection in memory.  This is the way to delay the saving of the server state until the client sends the exact value of the sequence number.  The construction of such a construction allows you to make sure that the client sent the server exactly the answer that is expected of him, and not some arbitrary value. <br><br>  <b>Student:</b> does the SNc save only limited time? <br><br>  <b>Professor:</b> Yes, the server does not store the SNc value all the time, and this is not very good.  I did not show this in the diagram, but here at the end of the third line there is a field that shows that this packet has no data, but it only includes the sequence number SNc because it has this field. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bv/5t/xz/bv5txzbklzepqcnw7bmu9n9ykki.jpeg"><br><br>  Thus, the server can restore the SNc value, because the client is going to include it in this package anyway.  Previously, it did not matter, but now it seems to be relevant.  We are not going to check anything here, but the existence of such a field is in itself a good thing.  However, it has some sad consequences.  For example, if you use some complex things that can be abused.  But this is not as bad as overflowing the server with client requests. <br><br>  Because the only thing that worries us is the release of the storage of this table and the confidence that the connections are established with genuine customers.  And if this client establishes a million connections with me, I will simply stop receiving requests from him, it is quite simple.  The problem is that the fake addresses are difficult to distinguish from the addresses of genuine customers. <br><br>  <b>Student:</b> Do I need to store a timestamp? <br><br>  <b>Professor:</b> yes, there is a clever thing here!  When we get the value of the serial number of SNs in the third step, we need to figure out how to calculate the input data for this function F to verify that this value is correct.  Therefore, we take the time stamp located at the end of the packet and use it to calculate it inside the function.  Everything else we can recover.  We know who just sent us the third step and the packet, we have all these fields and our key, which, again, is still secret, and the timestamp of the last 8 bits of the sequence.  In this case, it may happen that we exclude too old timestamps by simply disabling the old connections. <br><br>  <b>Student:</b> I believe that you use it when you are attacked, just because you lose 8 bits of security, or for some other reason? <br><br>  <b>Professor:</b> yes, it is not very good, it has many bad properties.  In a sense, we really lose 8 bits of security.  Because now the undeniable part is only 24 bits instead of 32. <br><br>  Another problem is what happens if you lose certain packages?  In TCP, it is assumed that if the third packet is lost, then the client may not wait for anything.  Or, I'm sorry, maybe the protocol that we run on top of this TCP connection is a protocol that assumes that the server initially has something to say, so I connect to it and just listen to the answer.  And in SMTP, for example, the server must send me something like a greeting via the protocol.  Suppose I connect to the SMTP server, send the third packet, I think I did everything and just wait for the server to answer me, for example: <br><br>  “Hello, this is an SMTP server, please send me your email”! <br><br>  So, this third package may be lost.  In real TCP, the server remembers that in the second step, it responded to the client, but never received a response packet from it.  Therefore, the server will send the second packet to the client again to restart the third packet.  Of course, if the server does not store any state, it has no idea what to send.  This makes the connection setup somewhat problematic, because both sides will wait for the response step from each other.  The server does not even know that the client is waiting for a response from him, and the client is waiting for a server response, although he is not going to respond, because he does not store the state.  Therefore, this is another reason why you do not constantly use the productive server mode. <br><br>  <b>Student:</b> you may also have data loss if you set up two very short connections from one host immediately. <br><br>  <b>Professor:</b> yes, definitely.  Another thing is that we refused to use this old-style ISN sequence number, which increased the independence of these multiple connections in a short time from each other.  I think that there are a number of compromises, we just talked about three of them, so there are a few more reasons for concern. <br><br>  If we could develop a protocol from scratch, striving for the best, we could just have a separate good 64-bit volume for the F function and a 64-bit volume for the time stamp, and then we could use it constantly, without giving up all these nice things. <br><br>  <b>Student:</b> should the SNs in the second and third step be the same? <br><br>  <b>Professor: of</b> course, because otherwise the server will not be able to conclude that this client received our package.  If the server did not verify that this SNs has the same meaning as before, then it could be even worse - after all, I could fake a connection from an arbitrary IP address in the first step, and then get this answer in the second step.  Or I would not even get this response, because it is sent to a different IP address.  Then in the third step, I establish a connection from another IP address.  At the same time, the server would support the established connection, wait for me to send the data, and so on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4l/ta/ju/4ltajum6836awmvn0sgd43vygee.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Student:</b> but then the timestamp will be different, right?  So how can the server recalculate it using a new timestamp if it does not store the state? <br><br>  <b>Professor:</b> as I said, these time stamps are quite coarse grained and graduated in minutes.  If you connect at the same minute, then everything is fine; if you connect at the border of a minute, this is too bad. <br><br>  Another problem with this scheme is that it is imperfect in many ways.  But most production systems, including Linux, have ways of finding too many entries in this table.  And when there is a threat of its overflow, the system switches to another scheme. <br><br>  <b>Student:</b> if an attacker controls a large number of IP addresses and does what you said, even if you switch ... <br><br>  <b>Professor:</b> yes, in fact you can do little.  The reason why we care so much about this scheme is that we wanted to filter or somehow distinguish between the attackers and the "good guys."  If an attacker has more IP addresses and simply controls more machines than good guys, then he can connect to our server, request multiple web pages, or keep in touch. <br><br>  And then it will be very difficult for the server to determine if requests are received from legitimate clients or is it just that the attacker links server resources.  So you are absolutely right.  This scheme only works when an attacker has a small number of IP addresses and wants to achieve the effect. <br><br>  And it is disturbing, because today some attackers control a large number of hacked computers of ordinary users.  This allows them to create DoS using a fleet of machines located around the world, and it is quite difficult to protect against this. <br><br>  I want to mention another interesting thing - the failure of the DoS service is bad in itself, but even worse when the protocols themselves contribute to the attack.  The attacker is aware of this and primarily attacks systems with protocols such as DNS.  The DNS protocol involves the client sending a request to the server, and the server sends the response back to the client.  And in many cases the response volume in bytes far exceeds the request volume. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sy/gv/mq/sygvmq26-ayo8twvl0f6lkxnkja.jpeg"><br><br>  You asked about the mit.edu server. Так вот, ответом на ваш запрос могут стать все записи, которые есть на сервере mit.edu — адрес электронной почты, почтовый сервер для mit.edu, назначенная запись, если она использует DNS SEC, и так далее. <br><br> Так что запрос может быть 100 байт, а ответ — более 1000 байт. Предположим, что вы хотите «зафлудить» какого-то парня большим количеством пакетов или использовать всю пропускную способность его канала связи. Вы можете использовать лишь немного своей пропускной способности, но зато можете организовать поддельные запросы к DNS-серверу от имени этого парня. Вам нужно отправить всего лишь 100 байт на какой-то DNS-сервер, сделав вид, что запрос исходит от этого бедняги, и в ответ сервер отправит ему 1000 байт от вашего имени. <br><br> Это проблемная особенность данного протокола, так как она позволяет увеличить пропускную способность атаки. И частично по той же причине, которую мы упоминали в случае с TCP SYN Flooding, DNS-серверу в этом случае очень трудно определить, является ли этот запрос действительным или нет. Потому что при продолжении обмена данными нет аутентификации или порядкового номера, говорящего, что соединение установлено с «правильным парнем». <br><br> На сегодня это всё ещё является проблемой DNS. И эта уязвимость часто используется для атак путём снижения пропускной способности канала клиента. Если ваша пропускная способность ограничена конкретной величиной, то для эффективной работы вам необходимо отразить подобную атаку с DNS-сервера. Однако эти сервера вынуждены отвечать на каждый запрос, потому что иначе возникнет угроза отклонения законных запросов. Так что на практике это большая проблема. <br><br> <b>Студент:</b> если вы сможете увидеть запрос злоумышленника на DNS-сервере и не отвечать на него… <br><br> <b>Профессор:</b> да, существует определённая возможность модифицировать DNS-сервер таким образом, чтобы он хранил какое-то состояние. <br><br> <b>Студент:</b> так почему же данная схема используется до сих пор, если она не предусматривает сохранение состояния? <br><br> <b>Профессор:</b> я думаю, что сейчас некоторые люди начинают модифицировать DNS-сервер, чтобы попытаться сохранить состояние. Однако существует так много DNS-серверов, что это не имеет значения. Даже если вы делаете по 10 запросов к каждому DNS-серверу, каждый пакет усиливается некоторыми существенными факторами, и сервер должен на них отреагировать, потому что, возможно, эти запросы исходят от законного клиента. Так что это проблема. Да, вы правы, если бы это был один DNS-сервер, то его модификация не представляла бы такого труда. <br><br> Проблема также заключается в том, что корневые серверы DNS не являются одной машиной, это стойки и стойки серверов, потому что они массово используются, и поэтому хранить состояние для такого большого количества машин очень сложно. Однако рост вредоносных вмешательств приводит к тому, что поддерживать сохранение состояния становится всё более и более целесообразным. <br><br> Я думаю, что общий принцип, которому вы хотите следовать в любом протоколе, и это может быть хорошим принципом – это заставить клиента делать, по крайней мере, столько же работы, сколько делает сервер. Но проблема в том, что клиент не может делать столько же, сколько делает сервер. Поэтому сервер должен ему в этом помочь. <br><br> Если бы вы создавали DNS-сервер с нуля и это было бы вашей большой проблемой, то вы смогли бы решить её довольно просто. Клиент должен был бы отправить запрос, который имеет дополнительное заполнение байтами просто для увеличения пропускной способности канала, и тогда сервер будет отсылать обратно ответ такого же объёма. <br><br> И если вы хотите получить ответ большего объёма, то сервер скажет: «извините, ваше дополнение не было достаточно большим, пришлите мне ещё»! Таким образом, вы гарантируете, что DNS-сервер не может быть использован для усиления атак путём поглощения пропускной способности канала. <br><br> На самом деле, такого рода проблемы случаются и на более высоких уровнях. Часто в веб-приложениях имеются веб-службы, которые выполняют множество вычислений от имени одного запроса. На этом уровне DoS атаки состоят в том, что противники знают про ресурсоёмкость определённого вида операций и просто высылают запрос на выполнение этой операции снова и снова. Если вы тщательно не разработаете свой протокол и приложение так, чтобы позволить клиенту доказать, что он выполняет не меньший объём работы, чем сервер, то защититься от таких вещей довольно трудно. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ub/2r/rc/ub2rrcc5_hvwg939goz50wj08ve.jpeg"><br><br> Последнее в этой статье, о чём я хочу упомянуть, это атаки маршрутизации. Причины этих атак интересны тем, что выносят на поверхность проблемы транспортного уровня протокола и дают возможность увидеть, что в приложении происходит не так, как следует. <br><br> Особенно интересным примером является протокол маршрутизации, для которого доверие к пользователю является основой работы, и часто это истолковывается неверным способом. Даже на сегодня не существует безупречных механизмов аутентификации. <br><br> Возможно, самым ярким примером является протокол DHCP, который используется для подключения к беспроводной или проводной сети. Компьютер просто отправляет пакет, говоря, что хочет IP-адрес. При этом, например, MIT сервер DHCP, получив ваш пакет, отправляет его обратно, указывая, что вот IP-адрес, который вы должны использовать, вот DNS-сервер, который вы должны использовать, и вот другие полезные данные конфигурации для этого соединения. <br><br> Проблема состоит в том, что пакет запроса DHCP просто вещает в локальной сети о попытке связаться с DHCP-сервером, потому что вы на самом деле заранее не знаете, что собирается делать DHCP-сервер. Вы просто подключаетесь к сети в первый раз и посылаете запрос, и ваш клиентский компьютер не знает, что делать и кому доверять. Следовательно, любая машина в локальной сети может перехватывать эти запросы DHCP и отвечать клиенту с любого IP-адреса, говоря: «эй, вы должны использовать мой DNS-сервер вместо реального»! Это даёт злоумышленнику возможность перехватить будущие запросы DNS от клиента и так далее. <br><br> Поэтому я думаю, что эти протоколы довольно сложно исправить. В глобальном масштабе такие протоколы, как BGP, позволяют любому участнику сети объявлять определенный префикс IP-адреса, чтобы отсортировать и маршрутизировать пакеты для злоумышленника. При этом случались атаки, в которых маршрутизатор, участвующий в BGP, говорил: «о, я знаю очень быстрый способ достичь этого конкретного IP-адреса!», и тогда все остальные маршрутизаторы отвечали ему: „ОК, конечно, мы отправим вам эти пакеты“. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/z2/tv/1u/z2tv1u_2r9qcpdqgfpgtf22xxgq.jpeg"><br><br> Наверное, чаще всего этим злоупотребляют спамеры, которые хотят рассылать свой спам, но их старые IP-адреса везде занесены в черный список. Поэтому они просто выбирают случайный IP-адрес и объявляют, что да, их IP-адрес теперь расположен здесь. Затем они как бы объявляют этот IP-адрес в сети, отправляют с него спам и отключаются. Сейчас таких случаев становится все меньше, но полностью искоренить подобное трудно. Потому что для того, чтобы это исправить, вы должны знать, кто действительно владеет этим IP-адресом. Без этого трудно обойтись при создании глобальной базы данных криптографических ключей для каждого провайдера в мире, однако люди прилагают немало усилий, чтобы создать эту базу. <br><br> То же самое относится и к DNS SEC. Для того, чтобы знать, какую подпись искать в DNS, у вас должен быть криптографический ключ, связанный со всеми сетевыми сущностями в мире. На сегодня это невозможно, но к этому нужно стремиться, потому что, безусловно, это самая большая проблема для широкого распространения DNS SEC. <br><br> Итак, я полагаю, что из этой статьи следует выбрать информацию, чего вообще не следует делать в протоколах. Я хочу заострить ваше внимание на одной важной вещи: пока безопасность и целостность являются важными свойствами и движущей силой более высоких уровней абстракции, таких как криптографические протоколы в приложениях, которые мы рассмотрим в следующей лекции, основными требованиями, предъявляемыми к сети, должны стать доступность и сопротивляемость DoS — атакам. Потому что эти свойства гораздо труднее достигнуть в стеке на более высоких уровнях. <br><br> Таким образом, вы должны стремиться к тому, чтобы избежать таких вещей, как, атаки SYN Flooding и RST атаки, позволяющие разорвать соединение произвольного пользователя сети. Это вещи, которые действительно вредны на низком уровне и которые трудно исправить на высоком уровне. Но более–менее обеспечить целостность и конфиденциальность данных можно с помощью шифрования. О том, как это сделать, мы поговорим в следующей лекции о «Цербере». <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BZTWXl9QNK8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Full version of the course is available <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-858-computer-systems-security-fall-2014/">here</a> . <br><br>  Thank you for staying with us.
