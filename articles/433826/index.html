For me, this was a real discovery that the "club of persimmon fans" is so great and multiethnic.  One of the most frequently asked questions was "Who should not eat persimmon? How much can children eat persimmon? What kind of blockage can there be from persimmon?"  etc.  Gathering my strength, I wrote another article in which I tried to answer these questions in detail.  In addition, if you are interested in how the "knitting taste" of persimmon is associated with fish, that they are treated with tannins and why you can not be afraid of "gastric stone" - I traditionally ask for cat. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pp/sd/ei/ppsdei1ijp35icprq5gtfm10ofc.jpeg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  In most cases, the stumbling block in persimmon gastronomy is its astringent taste. <br>  For <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582,_%25D0%2594%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD_(%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD)">captain John Smith</a> was right in his book of 1624, The Common History of Virginia, when he wrote about an unripe persimmon, "... <em>being collected before it is ready, he will tear off a man's mouth in immense suffering</em> ...". </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">... being gathered to readiness, he will tear open a man’s mouth in immense suffering ...</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rr/wd/rb/rrwdrb40bsxkix1xcfepq1vagz0.jpeg"></div></div></div><br><p>  And although there are lots of ways to get rid of the knitting taste ( <del>  see the end of the article </del>  ), let me dwell on this phenomenon in more detail and bring some clarity. </p><br><h3>  About astringency </h3><br><p>  Speaking about persimmon, it is impossible not to say at least a couple of words about the mechanism of its "knitting action" or tartness.  We feel toughness when we try unripe persimmon, drink strong tea / coffee or dry red wine.  All of these components contain tannins.  And the interaction of tannins with special protein compounds present in the oral cavity forms the above-mentioned taste sensations.  These compounds are called mucins.  They are the main component of the secretion of all mucous glands. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ot/m4/jx/otm4jxage91rndcirkry6qvable.jpeg"></div><br><p>  High-molecular mucin that is adsorbed on the surface serves to lubricate the boundaries of the rubbing surfaces (for example, the oral cavity and food), and the free mucin in the volume of the secretion of the salivary glands is so-called.  colloidal stabilizer and regulates the viscosity and elasticity of saliva.  Therefore, any food and drinks can interact with saliva proteins both on the surface and in the solution volume (due to physicochemical interactions or changes in the conformation of saliva proteins) and actively influence the composition and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">rheological</a> properties of saliva. </p><br><p>  The mucin molecule (in the saliva there are so-called mucin-1 (molecular weight 250 kDa) and mucin-2 (molecular weight 100 kDa)) is like a comb and consists of the protein part (a solid line of peptides) and short polysaccharide chains consisting from fructose, galactose, N-acetylglucosamines and other sugars.  Having a gel-like consistency, these glycoproteins bind a large amount of water and provide uniform lubrication (by lowering the friction coefficient) and moistening the oral cavity.  Mucins form a barrier and protect sensitive mucous membranes from drying out and chemical and mechanical effects. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gv/tr/f4/gvtrf4igknjyk0nngvsikocv0e0.jpeg"><br><p>  In the normal state, the surface of the tongue and mouth is covered with a uniform thin film of saliva containing mucins.  Upon contact with products containing binders (tannins) components, the mucins, like any other proteins (as described above), enter into chemical interaction with tannins.  Their solubility in water decreases, aggregation and even precipitation occurs.  Those.  after contact with tannins, the smooth, glossy surface smeared with mucin-containing saliva begins to resemble a rough sandpaper formed by a multitude of micro-tear.  Those.  in its simplest use, a tart taste is when the tongue becomes less slippery. </p><br><p> This process is described in an interesting <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.201601667">paper</a> by a Sino-Korean team of researchers who created a "tongue emulator" of a plastic hydrogel containing mucin.  In the initial state, this object was elastic, with a very low coefficient of friction, and easily slid along an inclined surface.  The addition of tannin solution made the hydrogel sticky, forcing the water to lose actively and shrink in volume.  The mechanical strength of the "tongue" has increased significantly, the elasticity has decreased, on an inclined plane, he no longer slid.  As they say, zadubel ... Researchers did not stop at the results and developed special gloves "for holding fish" (!).  The slime that covers fish scales is similar in composition to saliva, which means, the researchers suggested, will also interact with tannin.  Gloves were created for testing that isolated the tannin solution on contact.  The fish was caught and ... retained. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-p/gu/n3/-pgun3csa7ll9_b2yhbvbyvavc8.jpeg"><br><p>  In Figure E) - a scheme for fishing with the use of "tannino-gloves", F) - the fish is fixed with the help of "tannino-gloves", G) - fishing is failed if a common glove is used. </p><br><p>  It would seem that the idea that they are tannins are bad and harmful, the language deprives of its important qualities.  And no.  In fact, this is a fairly common class of compounds actively used in medicine. </p><br><h3>  Tannins of plants </h3><br><p>  In fact, tannins or <u>tannins (tannins)</u> are organic compounds of complex composition, so-called.  polyphenols.  This is how these compounds look like (for example, tannin powder): </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ks/e4/pz/kse4pzuhuprinrugzsxaklb-sfk.jpeg"></div><br><p>  Tannins (from the Latin name of Celtic oak - "tan") are high-molecular polyphenolic compounds, the distinguishing feature of which is the ability to turn raw animal skins into a durable, waterproof and rot-resistant product - the skin.  Usually, oak bark was used for this process, which later gave the name to the tanning process and the class of substances (“tannic”).  For the first time the term "tannins" was introduced into circulation in 1796 by the French researcher P. Seguin.  Tanning is a complex physico-chemical process of formation of a stable structure due to the appearance of hydrogen, covalent and ionic bonds between collagen molecules and phenolic groups of tannins. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ue/on/9h/ueon9heeyynhlgx-h9hkfvv3hgw.jpeg"></div><br><p>  The peculiarity of the process is that tanning occurs only in the case of a sufficiently large size of tannin molecules (molecular weight 500-3000).  Low-molecular compounds have an astringent taste, but are not suitable for tanning.  According to the most frequently used classification by Freudberg, tannins are divided into two large groups: hydrolyzable and condensed. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zc/y9/zv/zcy9zvmtklwsyhag-wj5iydfo-g.jpeg"></div><br><p>  Hydrolyzed tannins under the action of acid or enzymes are hydrolyzed into their constituent parts.  But condensed tannins under the action of acids undergo further compaction and condensation, and the resulting red-brown condensation products are called <u>flobaphenes</u> . </p><br><p>  As I already mentioned, tannin solutions bind to proteins (as well as alkaloids and heavy metal salts) to form insoluble compounds.  Human skin proteins are no exception.  Upon contact with protein molecules in the mucous membranes or superficial layers of the skin, tannins fix these molecules and cause them to thicken, forming a film impermeable to water.  Their medical use in the form of astringents is based on this, since  The film formed on the mucous membranes prevents further inflammation, and, applied to the wound, they coagulate blood and therefore act as local hemostatic agents.  Best of all, tannins act as astringents. </p><br><blockquote>  <b><a href="https://www.rlsnet.ru/books_book_id_4.htm">Astringents</a></b> when applied to mucous membranes, skin.  wound surfaces cause compaction of the surface layer of the tissue (tanning effect) with a decrease in its permeability due to nonspecific physicochemical changes of colloids of cells, extracellular fluid, mucus, exudate.  Interacting with proteins, they form insoluble albuminates (coagulation).  Forms a dense elastic film that protects tissues from the effects of irritating substances, reduces pain, contributes to the narrowing of the capillaries, reducing hyperemia, compaction of the vascular wall, reducing the secretion of glands and enzyme activity.  Reducing tissue permeability blocks exudation.  Reducing the activity of enzymes, drugs extinguish the "fire exchange" in the inflammation.  The combination of these effects explains the local anti-inflammatory effect of astringents.  Coagulating plasma proteins, they help to stop capillary bleeding.  Coagulation of microbial cell proteins provides antimicrobial action. </blockquote><p>  Externally used to stop small capillary bleeding on the skin, to treat minor burns, such as sunburn, to treat wounds and frostbite (due to the tanning effect).  No wonder in the first part of the story about persimmon I mentioned that Koreans treat her for burns and wounds.  Actual, the same was used on our latitude, but instead of persimmon they used more accessible oak bark.  Inside tannins are used to slow down the strong motility of the gastrointestinal tract resulting from indigestion ( <u>Important! But for people prone to constipation, the situation will only get worse!</u> ), Mouthwash, if there is inflammation in the mouth or gums (bleeding), throat tonsillitis, for washing the stomach in case of diarrhea, against inflammations that form on the mucous membranes of the intestines and stomach.  Due to the ability to form insoluble compounds with glycosides, alkaloids and heavy metal salts, tannins are used as antidotes.  Hydrolyzed and condensed tannins exhibit high P-vitamin activity and anti-sclerotic effect, which is why doctors often recommend persimmon to those who suffer from varicose veins. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uy/jp/6e/uyjp6eqbpme1mfxhhgl2sn9fqug.jpeg"></div><br><p>  One of the strongest tannins on the content of the plant of our latitudes: a - alder, b - lingonberry, c - bird cherry. </p><br><p>  The following herbal preparations can be cited as examples: the <strong>Tannin</strong> preparation, obtained from the leaves of skumpii tanning and the leaves of sumach tanning leaves, has an astringent, anti-inflammatory and antiseptic effect.  It is used in the form of solutions (for washing the stomach for poisoning), lotions for burns, rinses, ointments.  <strong>Altan</strong> and <strong>Camilal preparations</strong> with antimicrobial, anti-edematous activity and local hemostatic effect are obtained from the alder <strong>seedlings</strong> .  Oak bark and cherry fruit are actively used as an individual astringent and anti-inflammatory agent.  Fruits / leaves of bilberry and lingonberry are used in the form of drugs <strong>Arfazetin</strong> , <strong>Mirfazin</strong> with hypoglycemic action.  Strong black tea has anti-inflammatory action, is used as an antidote for alkaloids poisoning. </p><br><h3>  Stone in the stomach </h3><br><p>  The most common horror story of opponents of persimmon is the argument "a stone is formed in the stomach."  Well, let's go about the stone to dot the i's, especially since the tannins, the participation of which is here, we have already considered.  In general, this is how this very stone describes Wikipedia: </p><br><blockquote>  Bezoar, bezoar stone (Pers. بازهر bâzahr "padzahra" - translated as "antidote") - a foreign body in the stomach, dense calculus formed in the gastrointestinal tract when swallowing certain substances of natural or synthetic origin </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xy/fx/xa/xyfxxan9nm15aof4hz1wcztenbc.jpeg"><br><p>  Bezoars have been known since ancient times and were previously highly valued for their properties, since they were thought to possess the power of a universal antidote to any poison.  Most often concrements were found in mountain goats, in whose stomachs they were represented as grayish-blue dense formations of wool, mucus and leaves.  This animal (in the picture) even got its name from the name of the stone - bezoar goat. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tv/df/g4/tvdfg4rhkv9na2j-qknuj-dv1eu.jpeg"></div><br><p>  It is believed that bezoar goats are one of the ancestors of modern domestic goats. <br>  Surprisingly, even today (in the world of CRISPR and monoclonal antibodies), people who believe in miracles still remain, and bezoars are quite expensive on the black market.  Therefore, the species continues to be under threat due to poachers. </p><br><p>  <s>Even more surprising are the <u>real modern prices</u> for the so-called.</s>  <s>gall bezoara animals.</s>  <s><a href="https://zen.yandex.ru/media/vputi/fermer-obnarujil-kamen-i-zarabotal-300-000--5c0c017446ef5c00aaa7ec0a">Especially</a> in China, traditionally living in its own world of alternative medicine.</s> </p><br><p>  Bezoars occur mainly in ruminants.  In humans, bezoars are relatively rare.  In the national gastroenterology, the first mentions of pathology are found at the beginning of the 19th century in the works of the Russian surgeon V.M.  Mouse.  <u>Gastric stones are rare, in the early 1990s.</u>  <u>about 400 cases of the disease have been described.</u> <br>  There is also a <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0967-3334/31/2/001/meta">pseudo</a> - <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0967-3334/31/2/001/meta">besoar</a> - some indigestible object that is intentionally introduced into the digestive system for medical purposes (for restoring the volume of the stomach, for example). </p><br><p>  Bezoars <a href="http://www.10gkb.by/informatsiya/stati/bezoar-zheludka">may have</a> different composition and consistency (loose, dense, firm, elastic).  Depending on the type of constituent components, the calculus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bezoar">can be</a> both organic and inorganic.  The most common are <b>phytobezoars</b> .  They make up to 70% of all bezoars.  Formed by eating peels, seeds, rinds of berries and fruits (persimmon, cherry-cherry, hawthorn, grapes, figs, etc.).  Vegetable substances (undigested lignin, cellulose, tannins celery, pumpkin peel, grape skin, prunes, raisins, other vegetables and fruits) are gradually overgrown with mucus, fat and mineralized.  Concrements have a different consistency, fetid odor, dark green or brown color.  There are other varieties - see under the spoiler. </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Common Bezoar Types</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p>  <b>Trichobezoar (pilobezoar)</b> .  Ranked second in frequency.  They represent a felt-like clumps of hair with impurities of mucus and food particles and are formed with regular hair ingress into the stomach.  There are such bezoars in children with schizophrenia who suffer from trichotillomania - obsessive pulling of hair.  In addition, they are found in people with mental disorders who bite their hair and hair processing professionals (hairdressers). </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l6/be/ej/l6beejkgz-yxjuyhpfam3zmumze.jpeg"><br><p>  From such a "soft toy" was removed from a young girl who lived with the habit of constantly biting her hair ... </p><br><p>  <b>Stibobezoary</b> .  Formed with frequent consumption of fatty products of animal origin (goat, lamb and beef tallow without heat treatment).  Once in the stomach, the food is transformed, compacted and forms fatty stones. <br>  <b>Shellakobezoary</b> .  Occur when using in food inedible products of chemical origin (nitrolak, glue BF and polish alcoholics, paint).  When entering the stomach, the substance interacts with water and precipitates.  Shellac stones have a viscous consistency, slightly rough surface, dark brown color. <br>  <b>Laktobezoar</b> .  Formed in newborns, feeding which is carried out by an artificial mixture with a high content of lactose and casein.  Premature babies tend to concretions. </p><br><p>  Other types of bezoars that are found in isolated cases are mentioned in the scientific literature.  <u>Pixebozoarya</u> - the use or swallowing of chewing gum and plasticine by children, ingestion of resin or vara in the stomach.  <u>Hemobezoaroids</u> are formed during prolonged swallowing of blood in patients with nasal and esophageal bleeding with portal hypertension and lupus erythematosus.  <u>Pharmacobezoar</u> may occur when taking insoluble and insoluble drugs (aluminum hydroxide, activated carbon, etc.).  <u>Mixed bees</u> are made of yarn, wool, pieces of wood. </p></div></div><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nq/sq/ez/nqsqezymryvyuqywdpwqvdzvje8.jpeg"><br><p>  Predisposing factors of phytobezoaces are: </p><br><ul><li>  Disruption of food culture.  Poor chewing of coarse-fiber heavy food (+ problems with teeth), swallowing fruit pits </li><li>  Insufficient excretion of hydrochloric acid, slow evacuation of the contents into the duodenum due to gastroenterological pathology and impaired gastric motility ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7">gastroparesis</a> , secretory insufficiency, diabetes and hypothyroidism and related decreased motility) </li><li>  Excess reproduction of fungi of the genus Candida ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7">candidiasis</a> ) in the stomach initiates the formation of fungal bezoars .; </li><li>  Surgery on the stomach.

This type of calculus is called <a href="http://medind.nic.in/imvw/imvw2885.html"><u>diospirobezoarami</u></a> .  Clinical manifestations in our latitudes are rare (for we have a persimmon only for the New Year), but in countries where persimmon is grown, it is found quite often.  The formation of phytobezoars from persimmon is due to a chemical reaction between the hydrochloric acid of the stomach and flobatannin (see “Tannins of plants”) contained in persimmon.  An important role is played in this and tannin persimmon (note my - "Hurmatannin"), with a maximum content in the peel of immature persimmon.  The substance was first isolated and studied by Japanese chemists <i>S. Komatsu</i> and <i>N. Matsunami back</i> in 1923.  The Japanese isolated phenolic compounds from the juice of immature persimmon and called them <i>shibuol</i> ( <i>shibuol</i> ).  Until 1961, its structure was unknown, and accordingly their mechanism of chemical interaction was unclear.  In 1961, using the analysis of methanol extracts, it was found that the main component of "hurmatanin" is the substance leukodelphinidin (5,7,3 ', 4', 5'-pentahydroxy-flavan-3,4-diol) -glucoside.  The formula for this wonderful substance is below: </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d8/oo/rx/d8oorxim4yutj3parjd88lg9abe.jpeg"></div><br><p>  The loss of astringency during the ripening of persimmon or in the case of various methods of converting persimmon fruit binders into sweet ones is interpreted as a decrease in soluble shibuol through molecular condensation.  At one time, the Japanese conducted an experiment by adding hydrochloric acid to a suspension of persimmon peel.  The coagulum obtained was very loose and did not closely resemble a human bezoar.  In this way it was found that the transformation of soluble Shibuol into insoluble is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for the formation of a stone.  Some high molecular weight binding agent + mechanical effect on the stomach must also be present. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/br/aw/3d/braw3dythsto8yerwztduwne_lg.jpeg"></div><br><p>  Stages of obtaining a synthetic gastric stone: 1 - a suspension of persimmon before processing, <br>  2,3 - Early stages of rotation after the addition of hydrochloric acid and flocculant; 4 - After 2 hours of rotation of the system. </p><br><p>  When the authors took a suspension of persimmon, added hydrochloric acid and a high molecular weight flocculant ( <i>KONANFLOC ZH-760</i> , an aromatic polyamide ~ nylon) and additionally subjected to slow rotation to simulate active gastric motility, the result was a synthetically bezoar, quite like a human.  It remained to find a source of high-molecular compounds (nylon in the stomach, to put it mildly, a rather rare guest).  Here it was assumed that gastric juice and saliva contain a significant amount of viscous substances, in the role of which mucin-1 and mucin-2 mentioned above can be used (see “On Tolerance”).  In addition, the rind of persimmon also contains high-molecular compounds that can act as coagulants.  The researchers found that the suspension of persimmon in distilled water, without the addition of hydrochloric acid or flocculant showed clearly visible coagulation.  In addition, soluble persimmon schibuol precipitates proteins and starch rather well, and insoluble actively adsorbs them.  In turn, the Shibuol-protein and Shibuol-starch complexes later also participate in the adhesion of persimmon slices.  Those.  For the formation of calculus necessarily need a significant amount of high molecular weight organic substances.  A mechanism has been proposed as follows: </p><br><ol><li>  When using the immature fruits of persimmon or persimmon knitting varieties, in the stomach, under the action of inorganic and organic electrolytes, a loose coagulate is formed, consisting of fragmented pieces of persimmon.  The sources of electrolytes are the persimmon itself and the food that is taken simultaneously with it, as well as gastric juice and saliva. </li><li>  Insoluble schibuol, precipitated with hydrochloric acid, various complexes of schibuol (due to adsorption) and other high-molecular compounds, accelerates the coagulation of the suspended persimmon pieces, acting as a kind of binder </li><li>  The coagulum becomes dense and gradually dehydrated.  Compaction occurs due to kinetic energy, which is released as a result of contraction of the stomach walls and body oscillations in the process of human movement. </li></ol><br><p>  And already the traditional " <b>how to be saved</b> ." Фитобезоар, в отличие от, к примеру, трихобезоара для которого показано только оперативное лечение ("неперевариваемый" кератин волос устойчив по отношению к большинству доступных протеолитических ферментов), вполне можно уничтожить без неприятных операций. Традиционно желудочный камень идентифицируют с помощью эндоскопа, и небольшие конкременты пытаются механически <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2673384/">извлечь</a> с помощью специальных <a href="">корзинок</a> или <a href="">ловушек</a> . Если камень достаточно большой, его предварительно <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2673384/">дробят</a> на мелкие части (как камни в почках или в желчном пузыре) с помощью механической/электрогидравлической литотрипсии, или с помощью твердотельного Nd:YAG лазера (алюмо-иттриевый гранат («YAG», Y <sub>3</sub> Al <sub>5</sub> O <sub>12</sub> ), легированный ионами неодима (Nd) с длиной волны 1064 нм). Также для уменьшения размера используют химическое воздействие ферментами группы целлюлаз (катализирующих гидролиз целлюлозы с образованием глюкозы) или папаином. </p><br><blockquote> Папаин (лат.

Интересно, что для растворения диоспиробезоара лучше всего подходит <a href="https://www.wjgnet.com/1948-5190/full/v7/i4/336.htm">самая обычная "вредная" Coca-Cola</a> . Притом работает она гораздо лучше чем пищеварительные ферменты, вроде папаина и "полезной" Coca-Cola Zero. Почему так происходит — непонятно, вопрос ждет своих <del> биохимиков </del> исследователей... </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qg/7z/dt/qg7zdtkfimmrnyjk_lzav5gyzki.jpeg"></div><br><p> Ну и только <u>в исключительных случаях</u> (очень большого конкремента, или очень старого и минерализованного), когда неинвазивные методы оказались неэффективны — приходится оперировать и доставать камень вручную. </p><br><h3> Подведение итогов и раздача слонов </h3><br><p> Какой же из всего написанного следует вывод? А вывод прежний — хурму есть нужно, потому что все ее недостатки занимают мизерную часть от достоинств. </p><br><p> "Страшные и опасные" таннины, они же дубильные вещества, содержаться в огромном количестве фруктов и ягод (гораздо меньше их в овощах). </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_u/uf/pf/_uufpfm62sb19m9hlndcruyeqiu.jpeg"></div><br><p> Черника, ежевика, клубника, малина, брусника, вишня, ананас, лимон, апельсин, грейпфрут, манго, киви, нектарин, персики, груша, абрикос, слива, банан, авокадо и гранат — и это далеко не полный перечень. Те же "родненькие" яблоки вообще <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/134/3/613/4688609">по данным</a> <em>Journal of Nutrition</em> (aka широко известный в узких кругах академический "Журнал питания") являются основным источником поступления дубильных веществ в организм. Про полезные их свойства лишний раз повторяться не буду (потому что писал и в <a href="https://habr.com/post/433610/">Заметки фитохимика. Хурма</a> и в разделе "Дубильные вещества в растениях" данной статьи). Для любителей дополнительного чтения могу порекомендовать статью <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mnfr.200900039">Tannins: Current knowledge of food sources, intake, bioavailability and biological effects</a> в журнале <em>Molecular Nutrition and Food Research</em> ("Молекулярное питание и исследования пищевых продуктов"). </p><br><p> Как упоминалось в разделе посвященному образованию фитобезоаров, обязательным условием для формирования конкремента является наличие а)таннинов в качестве клея/сорбента б)высокомолекулярных наполнителей (целлюлоза, лигнин и т.п.). Навскидку даже можно сказать, что примерно <u>сравнимым с хурмой</u> потенциалом к образованию желудочного конкремента могут обладать ананас и груша (источники таннинов+грубые волокна клетчатки). Но я ни разу не слышал от кого-то, что "не ешьте много груш — образуется камень и закупорит желудок", а про хурму — слышу это часто (особенно после выхода первой моей статьи). Так что, рекомендую взять на заметку ;) <del> Да и вообще, так как хурма в наших краях фрукт сезонный, то гораздо больше вероятность получить желудочный камень от волос, жевательной резинки, или хорошего бараньего плова (трихо-, шеллако- или стибобезоар). </del></p><br><p> Несмотря на все вышесказанное, "береженого бог бережет", поэтому однозначно нужно стараться выбирать <u>наименее</u> вяжущую хурму (если вы собираетесь ее есть, а не прикладывать к солнечным ожогам или царапинам на коже — здесь наоборот нужна максимально недозрелая, см. "Дубильные вещества в растениях"). </p><br><p> Народных <del> лайфхаков </del> способов для снижения терпкости придумано немало: и замораживание в холодильнике, и дозревание на подоконнике, и выдержка в пакете с яблоками/бананами/картошкой (как с "источниками этилена"). Можно вообще сделать "ход конем" и связать таннины до поступления в желудок, приготовив, к примеру фруктовый салат <em><a href="http://www.domitalia.ru/recepty-iz-italii/macedonia-fruktovyj-salat.html">macedonia</a></em> с какой-нибудь папайей ( <del> и папаином в ней </del> ), где алкалоиды/белки/таннины свяжутся друг с другом в безвредную и вкусную массу. <del> Можно попробовать и т.н. египетский с козьим сыром, казеин отлично свяжется с таннином... </del></p><br><p> Кстати, в извечном споре "снимать кожицу с хурмы/не снимать кожицу" приверженцы "снимать" все-таки одерживают победу, если речь идет о уменьшении количества дубильных веществ (другое дело, что этим хурма лишается и множества полезных веществ). Кстати, раз уж разговор зашел про снятие кожицы, просто не могу не упомянуть про такую вещь, как японская сладость "хосигаки" ( <em>hoshigaki</em> ). Китайцы делают сушеную хурму, а японцы — "хосигаки". Штука невероятно вкусная и с минимумом дубильных веществ (сладость эта иллюстрирует важность отсутствие кожицы, так как используется сорт хурмы "хатия", самой "танниносодержащей" среди множества сортов). Под спойлером — краткое введение в технологию: </p><br><div class="spoiler"> <b class="spoiler_title">Есть сушеная хурма, а есть - ХОСИГАКИ</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p> Японцы <a href="https://kitya.livejournal.com/365093.html">знают толк</a> и в приготовлении обезвоженной хурмы. И подходят к этому с присущим им национальным колоритом, прям как к заточке лезвия <a href="https://masterok.livejournal.com/723990.html">катаны</a> . Первым делом японские фермеры собирают хурму стараясь не повредить плодоножку (!). Затем с хурмы снимаю кожицу (максимально аккуратно, чтобы не повредить хвостик). Слишком острый нож не годится потому, что режет слишком глубоко, слишком тупой нож не годится, потому что мнёт мякоть. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iv/kn/gn/ivkngnmcsp5jqh8rf_ng6sa2uee.jpeg"></div><br><p> Чтобы сделать хосигаки идеально нужен японский опыт, этому искусству в Японии более 360 лет (не удивительно, потому что у японцев два любимых сезонных растения, весной — сакура, осенью — хурма). Затем оголенный фрукт омывается в бадье с японской водкой сётю "для стерилизации", обвязывается за веточку грубой хлопковой верёвкой и вывешивается для сушки там, где много солнца и свежего воздуха, но нет дождя. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/48/iz/gb/48izgbsmkg1reyizhq5uqwdbctu.jpeg"></div><br><p> Где-то через неделю хурма начинает съёживаться. И тогда начинается самый важный этап, ежедневное подавливание ("прожмякивание") хурмы, без которого она просто засохнет, но не даст жидкой карамельной внутренности. И так от четырёх до шести недель. Когда хурма покроется белоснежной корочкой выступившего сахара — хосигаки почти готовы. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/b8/bu/my/b8bumy_q-hxquull6ctowagj7ye.jpeg"></div><br><p> В завершение сухофрукт укладывают на мягкую подстилку из рисовой соломы свежего урожая. Рис впитывает влагу и не даёт фрукту загнить. </p><br><p> И хотя в Китае пытаются делать что-то подобное, и даже используют труд женщин для снятия кожицы на неком <a href="https://kak-eto-sdelano.livejournal.com/195504.html">подобии</a> токарного станка: </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gl/qc/wz/glqcwzjg32tzekf0s3yv9rrj_no.jpeg"></div><br><p> Но все равно, получается у них обычная сушеная хурма, а не ХОСИГАКИ... </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kn/vc/m-/knvcm-r2v-z4pfivlatuohxpvv0.jpeg"></div><br><p> О таком хайку не напишешь, и картинку на бамбуковом холсте не нарисуешь ... </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2d/ot/ws/2dotwsbec_umbs6ugpms9uh0f6e.jpeg"><br><p> Старая деревушка. <br> Ветки усеяны красной хурмой <br> Возле каждого дома. <br> <em>Мацуо Басё</em> </p><br><p> Хурму откусил – <br> Зазвонил колокол <br> Храма Хорюдзи <br> <em>Масаока Сики</em> </p><br><p> Целая роща <br> Китайских фонариков <br> Светится ярко. <br> Солнца нектаром полна, <br> Хурма делится мёдом. <br> <em>Неизвестно Кто (но мне понравилось...)</em> </p></div></div><br><p> Если для абсолютно здорового человека все описанные выше рекомендации — всего лишь рекомендации, так как организм вполне сможет справится и килограммом хурмы <del> (полтора — абсолютный <a href="https://medrussia.org/3240-ugrobila-sebya-khurmojj/">максимум</a> ) </del> (неизвестно, правда, сколько раз), то для людей, обладающих хроническими заболеваниями существуют достаточно объективные ограничения (некоторые из них уже упоминались как факторы, способствующие образованию безоаров). </p><br><p> Первым делом к "группе риска" относятся маленькие дети. Думаю многие из родителей знакомы с таким понятием как "запоры" и "колики" и представляют себе, сколько проблем несут эти заболевания. Поэтому с большой осторожностью кормите этим продуктом детей до 10 летнего возраста. На неокрепший кишечный тракт ребёнка хурма может подействовать непредсказуемо. Плюс ко всему есть еще и такое понятие как пищевая аллергия/непереносимость. Поэтому если уж никак нельзя отказаться — хотя бы ограничьтесь маленькой долькой. Аналогичной рекомендации могут смело придерживаться и беременные женщины (в основном, из-за вероятности аллергической реакции). </p><br><p> Во-вторых с осторожностью следует употреблять хурму людям, которые перенесли операции на кишечнике, так как таннины из-за своих свойств, могут привести к образованию спаек ("мостики" из соединительной ткани) и в итоге к острой кишечной непроходимости. Поэтому хурму запрещается есть хурму в послеоперационный период (снижается двигательная активность кишечника -&gt; спайки) и людям, ввиду особенностей ЖКТ, склонным к образованию запоров. </p><br><p> В-третьих аллергии. Несмотря на то что, как правило, человек знает характерные для него пищевые аллергены и старается их избегать, бывают разные ситуации. Лучше на всякий случай перепроверить. Аллерген хурмы известен в миру под кодовым обозначением <strong>F301 Persimmon</strong> и стимулирует организм на интенсивную выработку иммуноглобулинов класса E (общий IgE). По этому показателю и проводится оценка (концентрация lgE МЕ/мл: &lt;0,1 реактивность отсутствует или неопределенный уровень; 0,1-0,34 реактивность очень низкая; 0,35-0,69 реактивность низкая; 0,7-3,49 реактивность умеренная; 3,5-17,49 реактивность высокая; &gt;=17,5 реактивность очень высокая). Спокойно можно есть, если реактивность &lt; "низкая", с осторожностью — если "умеренная", во всех остальных случаях лучше не рисковать. </p><br><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And fourth. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Persimmon is not recommended for insulin-dependent people (type I diabetes). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">People with type II diabetes (with mild, moderate severity) should eat persimmon with caution. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is due both to the previously mentioned decrease in motility of the gastrointestinal tract recorded in diabetes, and the fact that the fruit contains a considerable amount of sugar. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Focus on the fact that the optimal amount of persimmon, which can be eaten at a time = 1 XE ( </font></font><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B0"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">bread unit</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the case of persimmon, this is about 50-70 grams, depending on the variety and degree of bedding.</font></font></p><br><p> <u><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For everyone else - there are no special restrictions, just "listen to your body." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The moral of this “fairy tale” is that it is much more effective to eat one persimmon throughout the week than to eat seven pieces at a time.</font></font></u> </p><br><p>  <b>Sergey Besarab</b> ( <a href="https://www.facebook.com/steanlab">Siarhei V.
