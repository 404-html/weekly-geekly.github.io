Most teams that use DevOps tend to shorten the delivery cycle time.  Therefore, developers are always happy to improve, which will reduce the amount of work and loss in time, because this accelerates the delivery of the product and improves business performance. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  With GitLab 11.4, we make the code review more efficient due to the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428940/">Merge Requests review</a> and the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428940/">file tree for changes</a> ;  We also present an alpha version of <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428940/">pluggable features (feature flags, feature toggle)</a> .  Auto DevOps and CI work better in conjunction with <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428940/">PostgreSQL database migration</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428940/">incremental scheduled deployment</a> .  Even Git is now faster with <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428940/">Git v2</a> support. </p><br><h2 id="revyu-koda">  Code Review </h2><br><p>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428940/">The Merge Requests Review</a> will help streamline comments on the code and Merge Requests.  Batch comments (batch comments) allows the reviewer to write comments on the code or merge-request and then arrange and send them in one package, and now tracking changes in the project has become easier. </p><br><p> The key step to delivering a high quality code is to choose the right people who review and confirm changes in the code.  Taking the owners of the code entered in release 11.3 ( <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2018/09/22/gitlab-11-3-released/">original article</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/post/425819/">translation</a> ) as a basis, GitLab now offers those who have been indicated in the <code>CODEOWNERS</code> file as reviewers and confirmations for merge requisition.  Thus, review and confirmation of changes will be carried out faster and more efficiently.  This is also useful for separating roles and responsibilities in a team, for example, if you need specific reviders for specific parts of the code. </p><br><p>  The presentation of the Merge-Request changes in the form of a file tree also makes it easier for the reviewers to view the many changed files and provide their feedback. </p><br><p>  Russell Levy, one of the founders and technical director of <a href="http://www.chorus.ai/">Chorus.ai</a> , told how the review of merge-requests and the tree view of files help their team: </p><br><blockquote>  <em>We conduct code review very carefully and usually write 10–20 comments on the average merge requester, and for some of them several iterations of discussions arise.</em>  <em>Review of Merge Requests reduces chaos and hitch during the review code process.</em> <br><br>  <em>For large merge-requests, the new representation of changes in the form of the file tree greatly facilitates and speeds up the review, allowing you to easily navigate through the code to understand the dependencies.</em> </blockquote><br><h2 id="podklyuchaemye-fichi">  Pluggable features </h2><br><p>  We present the alpha version of the functionality switching system - <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428940/">plugin features</a> .  Now teams can practice continuous delivery (delivery), adding new features to production in small batches, reducing the risk before full deployment. </p><br><h2 id="uluchsheniya-dlya-auto-devops-i-cicd">  Improvements for Auto DevOps and CI / CD </h2><br><p>  We display the ability to <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428940/"><code>подключения дополнительных файлов в файл .gitlab-ci.yml</code> using <code>include</code></a> from the Starter plan to the Core plan, making it available to all users.  All teams can now take advantage of this best practice and more effectively manage their CI / CD pipelines. </p><br><h2 id="i-eschyo-bolshe-usovershenstvovaniy">  And more improvements. </h2><br><p>  Together with the huge GitLab community in this release, we have added a lot of amazing improvements, including a new profile page view, quick access to status, highlighting <code>@имени</code> references, new quick actions, and the ability to close epics. </p><br><p>  Read on and you’ll learn about all the new features of GitLab 11.4. </p><br><p>  <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/events/">We invite you to our meetings</a> and <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/webcast/monthly-release/gitlab-11.4---collaboration/">webcast release 11.4</a> . </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f4/2b7/125/1f42b7125b8e58f40d41c3350cac3ffa.png" alt="GitLab MVP badge"></p><br><h2 id="mvphttpsaboutgitlabcommvp-etogo-mesyaca--luke-picciauhttpsgitlabcomqwertie">  This month's <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/mvp/">MVP</a> is <a href="https://gitlab.com/Qwertie">Luke Picciau</a> </h2><br><p>  Luke added the ability to <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428940/">download a file with recovery codes for two-factor authentication</a> , which will simplify their backup.  These codes will be required to log in to your GitLab account if you lose access to your phone or one-time secret secret. </p><br><p>  Thank you, Luke, for this contribution! </p><br><h2 id="osnovnye-fichi-reliza-gitlab-114">  The main features of the release of GitLab 11.4 </h2><br><h2 id="revyu-merzh-rekvestov">  Review of Merge Requests </h2><br><p>  (PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  Merge Requests Review is a powerful feature of GitLab.  Team members lead discussions tied to specific lines of code in the differential, and can even solve them.  However, this process can become difficult in merge-requests with large diffs.  Often the reviewer has to leave 10 or more comments in one discussion, and the 9th or 10th comment may make previous comments unnecessary.  As a result, the author of a merge-request receives a lot of notifications, and he has to deal with everyone. </p><br><p>  In this release, we present the Merge Requests Review.  This will allow the reviewer to write as many comments to the draft as he needs, make sure that they are all necessary, and then send them in one action.  Since drafts are saved in GitLab, the reviewer can divide his work into several sessions, for example, start a review on his desktop at work and finish at home on the tablet in the evening.  When these draft comments are sent, they are displayed as normal individual comments.  This will give individual team members the opportunity to review the code as it is convenient for them, but still with the entire team. </p><br><p>  In future releases, we will improve this feature and provide an opportunity to see a <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/4327">preview</a> before sending a comment package, as well as grouping notifications of these comments into <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/4326">one notification</a> . </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3eb/02e/595/3eb02e595c0fc2298fd63df938cc79ee.png" alt="Merge Request Reviews"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/discussions/index.html">Discussion documentation</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/1984">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h2 id="sozdanie-i-ispolzovanie-podklyuchaemyh-fich-v-vashih-prilozheniyah-alfa-versiya">  Creating and using pluggable features in your applications (alpha version) </h2><br><p>  (PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  This feature allows you to create plug-in features for your software and manage them directly in the product.  Simply create a new plugin feature, confirm it in your software using simple API instructions, and you will be able to control the behavior of your product in the field using the plugin feature in GitLab itself. </p><br><p>  Plug-in features offer switching functionality for your application.  It will allow teams to achieve continuous delivery (CD), sending new features in production in small batches for controlled testing, sharing sending features with launch for customers. </p><br><p>  At the moment, this system is presented in alpha version.  We suggest that you check how it works and leave feedback, but do not forget that the implementation may change in future releases. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/839/2de/788/8392de788a3c6d9c23d4d68050fc0e80.png" alt="Create and toggle feature flags for your applications (alpha)"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/operations/feature_flags.html">Documentation on plug-ins</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/6220">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h2 id="derevo-faylov-dlya-prosmotra-izmeneniy-merzh-rekvesta">  File tree for viewing merge-request changes </h2><br><p>  (CORE, STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, FREE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  Code review is a necessary practice for any successful project, but from the list of changes it can be difficult to understand what has changed.  To facilitate this task, GitLab now provides a tree of files for changes that you can search by. </p><br><p>  The file tree displays the structure and size of changes, as it already works with <code>diff-stats</code> , providing a general outline of changes and improving navigation between diffs.  A search through the tree gives the viewers the opportunity to limit themselves to part of the files along the path or file type, simplifying the review by specialists who want to focus only on the part of the merge request. </p><br><p>  Previously, the list of modified files was available through a drop-down list with a search that was best suited to go to a specific file. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e52/86f/488/e5286f4883f897949ec9fb0395275ac6.png" alt="File tree for browsing merge request diff"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/index.html">Documentation on merge-requests and navigation in diffs</a> and the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/14249">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h2 id="vladelcy-koda-predlagayutsya-v-kachestve-podtverzhdayuschih-merzh-rekvest">  Code owners are offered as confirmation merzh-request </h2><br><p>  (STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  It is not always obvious who will be the best candidate to review your changes.

They allow project participants to work together on code while respecting transparency.  We are in favor of the teams at the early stages sharing their work and using the WIP feature (“work in progress”, “in the process of development”), which shows that there is still active work on the Merge Request, and it is still too early to be inhibited. </p><br><p>  In this release, we added a new filter for Merge Requests, which works both at the group level and at the project level, which helps users to more easily distinguish between WIP and non-WIP requests (“in work” and “ready”).  This allows users to focus on merge requests, which are still in the early stages of work, unlike those that are closer to the final stages of testing before merge. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c3d/91b/d97/c3d91bd9747bd26bf85b08274a5fe322.png" alt="Filter by WIP merge requests"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/work_in_progress_merge_requests.html">Documentation on the WIP filter</a> and the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/13650">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h3 id="vydelenie-personalnyh-upominaniy">  Selection of personal references </h3><br><p>  (CORE, STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, FREE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  In discussing a task or a merge-request with a large number of participants, it is difficult to see which comments are addressed to you. </p><br><p>  Starting from this release, all references to the <code>@имени</code> current user will be highlighted in a different color, which allows you to immediately see which comments are sent to you and quickly focus on them. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/739/957/7dc/7399577dce5bd46d4b115d8e08a187b0.png" alt="Highlight `@ mentions` for yourself distinctly"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/issues_functionalities.html">Documentation of references</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/49036">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h3 id="vstavka-gfm-tablic-i-ssylok-v-markdown-po-kliku">  Inserting GFM tables and links into Markdown on click </h3><br><p>  (CORE, STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, FREE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  GitLab supports GitLab Flavored Markdown (GFM) in most text input fields, expanding the formatting capabilities with a simple syntax.  In particular, you can create tables on GFM.  Previously, this function was difficult to use, especially when working with large tables, since you had to enter a lot of characters or insert the previous table in order to format it as you like.

But sometimes it is difficult to remember which syntax to use in this case. </p><br><p>  Starting with this release, you can simply click on the button with the image of the table in the GFM editor, and the table will be inserted automatically.  Then you can easily fill in the cell values ​​of the table or extend it, customizing as you like.  This function can be used in descriptions and comments throughout GitLab. </p><br><p>  Similarly, by clicking on the insert link button, you will get a template for the URL into which you can quickly insert the link address and its name. </p><br><p>  Thanks to <a href="https://gitlab.com/gtsiolis">George Tsiolis</a> for developing table inserts! </p><br><p>  Thanks to <a href="https://gitlab.com/kingjan1999">Jan Beckmann</a> for developing URL insertion! </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ac/e90/81f/7ace9081fcb86cf5ec81dd6a0a41d7ec.png" alt="Click to insert Markdown table and link"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html">GFM documentation</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/29788">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h3 id="vklyuchenie-novyh-zadach-v-grafik-vypolneniya-rabot">  Inclusion of new tasks in work schedule </h3><br><p>  (STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD) </p><br><p>  Burndown charts help teams keep track of progress in performing their work on malystone.

Протокол Git v2 является важным обновлением <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/technical/pack-protocol.html">протокола передачи данных</a> , который отвечает за обмен данными между клиентом (вашим компьютером) и сервером (GitLab) при клонировании, извлечении и пушах. Новый протокол передачи данных повышает производительность фетчей и дает возможность и дальше улучшать протокол. </p><br><p> Ранее при вызове фетч-команд выводился список всех ссылок в репозитории. Например, если фетчить обновления для одной ветки ( <code>git fetch origin master</code> ) то вам также будет выводиться полный список всех ссылок. Если речь идет о большом проекте, вы можете получить более 100000 ссылок и десятки мегабайт данных. </p><br><p> Протокол Git v2 поддерживается начиная с версии Git v2.18.0, но не используется по умолчанию. Чтобы активировать его, вызовите команду <code>git config --global protocol.version 2</code> . На GitLab.com протокол Git v2 пока не подключен по умолчанию при работе по SSH.

При нажатии новой кнопки “Open projects” (открыть проекты) в профиле на первичном ноде, генерируется ссылка на список проектов на соответствующем вторичном ноде.
