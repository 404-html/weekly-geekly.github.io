  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Chinese scientists are considering creating a space power station</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/373/860/2e4/3738602e48b99545034135e5e47e7463.jpg"><br><br>  In theory, the placement of powerful power stations in outer space can lead to a significant reduction in human influence on the environment.  Now Chinese scientists are working on a project of a solar power station, which can be placed at an altitude of 36,000 kilometers above the Earth.  If such a project is implemented, it will become the most significant human space project, surpassing even the Apollo project and the ISS with the Mir.  True, so far this <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-03/30/c_134109115.htm">is only a project</a> , and it is still very far from its implementation. <br><br>  The orbital solar power station will be in geosynchronous orbit, and its main element will be solar panels of a huge area.  The electricity generated at the station will be transmitted using microwave radiation or lasers to a receiving station located on Earth.  In 1941, Azimov already described a similar station in one of his stories.  Wang Xiji, a scientist from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), as well as a member of the International Academy of Cosmonautics, argues that Azimov‚Äôs story has a serious scientific basis. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  True, it will become commercially viable only under one condition - if the area of ‚Äã‚Äãsolar panels is 5-6 square kilometers.  These are about two Central Parks from New York.  Most likely, from Earth such a station will be quite clearly visible.  Now scientists from various countries are creating their own projects of this station, offering a variety of options.  The orbital solar power station has a significant advantage over conventional solar stations: such an object will work 24 hours a day, regardless of whether it is night now or day.  The performance of solar panels in space will be 10 times higher than the performance of similar panels on Earth, according to Duan Bayen, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.  Duan believes that with the help of an orbital power station can solve the problem of lack of energy. <br><br>  The United States and Japan have already evaluated the possibility of creating such a station in orbit.  Japanese scientists are currently working on a project for wireless power transmission, and the results are quite promising.  In China, they also carried out and are conducting research related to the creation of such a station.  In 2010, the Chinese published a forecast according to which China will create an experimental orbital solar power station by 2030, and by 2050 a cost-effective station will be built. <br><br><h3>  Challenges and problems </h3><br><br>  It is clear that such a project has many problematic aspects.  In particular, the weight of the station of this size will be about 10 thousand tons.  But now there is practically no possibility of delivering such cargo into orbit.  A rare rocket can carry a load of 100 tons.  Therefore, we need powerful launch vehicles that can lift much more significant weight. <br><br>  The second problem - we need a new generation of solar panels, very thin and light.  The mass of the panel with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã1 square meter should not exceed 200 grams - this is what Van Sitszy thinks. <br><br>  The third problem is the delivery of energy to Earth.  The station will be economically profitable only if the efficiency of energy transfer using lasers or microwave radiation is higher than 50%. <br><br>  Nevertheless, Chinese scientists are confident that their country will be able to build a power plant in space.  Li Ming, vice president of the Chinese Academy of Space Technologies, is confident that China will be able to build an orbital station by 2020, and this will open up opportunities for the development of the space energy industry. <br><br>  Now the Chinese are working on the creation of ultra-powerful launch vehicles that will be able to send significant loads into space. <br><br>  Knowing the performance of the Chinese and their resourcefulness, one can be sure that China will achieve its goal. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374843/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374843/</a></p>
