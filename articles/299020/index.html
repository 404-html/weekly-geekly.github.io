  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The rush around the mobile banking system Mondo exceeded the expectations of the Crowdcube crowdfunding platform</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d49/01c/2ef/d4901c2ef931476193acded5840ecdf4.jpg"><br><br>  Most often, the founders of startups are looking for investments - the founders of the bank in the format of only Mondo applications do not know this.  In early February, the company announced the sale of assets of the company in the amount of ¬£ 1 million through crowdfunding as part of a ¬£ 6 million investment round. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The fundraising campaign began at 12 pm GMT on the crowdfunding platform Crowdcube and <a href="https://www.crowdcube.com/investments">the</a> Mondo <a href="https://www.crowdcube.com/investments">project page</a> almost immediately became inaccessible.  The excitement of users wishing to invest their funds in the project turned out to be so great that the service could not immediately restore access to the page from Mondo. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúWe are faced with an unprecedented demand for the Mondo mobile bank project, which caused problems in the operation of our website. <br><br>  Our engineering team is currently working on this problem, which demonstrates a high interest in Mondo.  We apologize for the inconvenience caused to all investors, ‚Äùsaid Crowdcube co-founder Luc Lang to Business Insider. </blockquote><br><br>  The founder of Mondo Tom Blomfield <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/mondo-crowdcube-crash-2016-2">confirmed to</a> reporters from Business Insider a heightened interest in the project.  Even before the start of the crowdfunding campaign, about 6,000 people registered to take part.  At the same time, the startup sent out more than notifications about the launch of the project page on the Crowdcube to 44,000 Mondo subscribers. <br><br>  The founders of the project likewise apologized for the inconvenience caused by the drop in service after the start of the crowdfunding campaign.  Because of this demand, it was decided to suspend fundraising for a short period of time. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúI would like to personally apologize to everyone who tried to invest in our project and could not do it.  Due to the high demand for investment in Mondo, the Crowdcube server could not stand the load, so we decided to suspend the campaign. <br><br>  If you were able to invest before the site stopped working, then your investment will be counted.  Those who invested several times by mistake will be personally contacted by representatives of the service and be sure to solve the problem, ‚Äùsaid Tom Blomfield, the founder of Mondo. </blockquote><br><br>  Mondo's work system is similar to that of Rocketbank and other mobile banks.  At the moment, the service has more than 1,500 cardholders registered, and by the end of the year it is planned to collect a user base of 100,000 active cards.  Currently Mondo is estimated at ¬£ 30 million and is engaged in obtaining a banking license to simplify working with its customers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299020/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299020/</a></p>
