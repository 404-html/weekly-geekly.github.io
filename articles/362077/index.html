  <section class="page js-page"><h1>In space via the Internet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Riddle: What do you need to do to tell your wife what you want to eat for dinner? <br>  Answer: Send a message or call. <br><br>  Imagine: in order to call from work to your home phone, you would first have to assemble telephone sets, lay a cable line from one device to another, install a mini-PBX.  Or if you are building, adjusting and maintaining base stations to call on a mobile phone, you use powerful long-range radios.  Such situations look like delusions and make it very difficult to solve a simple task - to transfer the necessary information from point A to point B. <br><br>  However, in space, the situation looks exactly like, as indicated in the fictional examples.  In near-Earth space, there is no other way to establish communication between the spacecraft and the operator of this device except by running the following algorithm: <br><br>  1. Design antenna systems and transceivers of the device and ground point. <br>  2. Build a ground-based point (or several) of data reception and transmission. <br>  3. Get a radio frequency band. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If the device is not in geostationary orbit, then it will not be permanently in sight of the ground point.  You have to either put up with a communication session or build additional ground points.  At the same time, there is one small problem - the earth's atmosphere is not completely transparent for electromagnetic waves - one has to fit into the existing ‚Äúwindows‚Äù of the spectrum and use relatively powerful transmitters, obtaining power consumption and mass. <br><br>  Infrastructure has long been created on Earth for us to solve our everyday personal and work information transfer tasks almost without thinking about the coverage map and network bandwidth: everywhere there is the Internet, mobile, wired communication. <br><br>  In space, such an infrastructure is not enough.  It is lacking in many small countries and institutions that dream of launching their microsatellites, but who are unable to rent or build and maintain ground-based space communications facilities. <br><br>  In my opinion, this infrastructure should look like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ba/4b9/224/1ba4b9224a044ce8b78de2923d8bbb57.png"><br><br>  1. The International Organization for Standardization adopts an open (!) Standard for space communications for spacecraft in low-Earth orbit (to begin with).  It standardizes transceivers, frequency bands, protocols, and everything else. <br><br>  2. A space provider or space communications provider (in a hurry to register a trademark) launches several satellites into a circular orbit somewhere lower than the orbits of the navigation satellites and higher than the satellite subscribers.  These satellites transmit data streams from microsatellites among themselves and to Earth at the ground points of the provider, from where this data is transmitted to the Internet. <br><br>  3. The microsatellite developer buys and mounts the standard transceiver module, antenna, and ... analogue of the SIM card. <br><br>  4. Solemn launch, microsatellite launch to a given orbit, switch on. <br><br>  5. The owner of the world satellite includes the computer, opens the browser, enters the IP address or domain name and gets access to his micro satellite via the Internet from anywhere in the world. <br><br>  I forwarded the letter containing the above reasoning to the Government of the Russian Federation, then it was redirected to Roskosmos, from where it received an answer signed by the deputy head of Roskosmos Mikhail Khaylov that Russia would launch the Luch relay system and the Gonets mobile satellite communication system. <br><br>  In my opinion, the ‚ÄúRay‚Äù and ‚ÄúGonets‚Äù systems are, firstly, too universal (they are intended to communicate with both low-orbit and ground-based and marine objects, and even with the upper stages of launch vehicles), and secondly If we want the whole world to use the infrastructure, and not just interested Russian enterprises, it should be based on open standards.  To create a commercially successful international provider company, the state structure cannot - not the profile. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362077/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362077/</a></p>
