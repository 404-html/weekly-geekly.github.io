  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How Yandex tried to copy my heat map service</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  About a year ago I did such a thing as <a href="https://kvartiri-domiki.ru/karta-cen">heat price maps</a> , I then described the whole process <a href="https://habr.com/post/335638/">in this article</a> .  The service turned out to be interesting, but it does not bring money at all, just a beautiful picture clearly showing where it is expensive, and where the image component is so cheap, so to speak, until recently, for some reason, there were no analogues on our real estate websites.  But the other day Yandex did the same. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A couple of weeks ago, I noticed a surge in the attendance of my cards.  In the metric it is clear that people suddenly began to look massively in search of something like " <i>Yandex heat price maps</i> ."  Well, I also googled, and experienced fear: what I considered to be my brainchild was suddenly made by Yandex - the largest IT company in Russia.  And a lot of news portals screamed about it in all search results.  Of course, I was intrigued, I wanted to see how the leading Russian IT specialists did the same.  And <a href="https://realty.yandex.ru/moskva_i_moskovskaya_oblast/kupit/kvartira/karta/%3Flayer%3Dprice-sell%26leftLongitude%3D37.277268%26bottomLatitude%3D55.639268%26rightLongitude%3D38.256424%26topLatitude%3D55.920982%26activePoint%3D55.79089%252C37.63668">that's what I saw</a> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sj/91/yh/sj91yhe6roufzcs3hootuq669qi.png"><br><br>  For comparison, here‚Äôs how it looks at me on a similar scale (clickable): <br><br> <a href="https://kvartiri-domiki.ru/karta-cen" title="Heat Map of Moscow"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mf/gu/tu/mfgutun-prtme2zfyifsmstin9y.png"></a> <br><br>  Maybe I made a mistake and did not go there, or did they still unfinished something?  But no, this is a full-fledged finished <a href="https://yandex.ru/blog/company/teplovye-karty-tsen-na-zhile">release from Yandex</a> , which they, through the press service, distributed on such a scale, as if they had revolutionized price analysis.  They even advertised on Vkontakte.  Despite the fact that there is only the city center and strange "cheap" spots on the area.  There is no opportunity to look at what objects are built colors, only points with approximate prices. <br><br>  No ability to customize the display.  All that can be done is to choose between renting and selling, plus a ‚Äúpayback forecast‚Äù sucked from the finger.  However, there should be a choice of scale, choice of markets: apartments, houses, plots, commerce;  opportunity to look at exactly what objects are being counted, all major cities, not just Moscow and St. Petersburg, etc. <br><br><h3>  The complexity of the process </h3><br>  The process of generating these maps is quite resource-intensive, and this is the main reason why I didn‚Äôt do all the regions, as well as many other display settings - even for rendering it takes 3 days, and the workload of my only server looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/40/ls/f5/40lsf5jq13vkduvw1ui9rjvtjpo.png"><br><br>  Well, that is, to the eyeballs.  The process starts on Friday morning and new maps are ready for each Monday. <br><br>  I have already described the technical details of the process in the original article, if anyone is interested, look <a href="https://habr.com/post/335638/">there</a> . <br><br>  I am sure that Yandex has no such problems, they have millions of ads all over Russia, enormous technical capacities and first-class specialists who are probably better programmers than me. <br><br><h3>  About the reaction of the media </h3><br>  In this situation, there is one moment that can affect any of us, namely, if you are a programmer or designer or someone else, and have done something cool, you have no chance to tell about it - you will not be listened to.  But when the conditional Yandex looks at your service and makes a copy of it, they will scream about it from all sides. <br><br>  The fact is that I sent to the editors of many publications an application for publishing material about my maps.  None of them published a word.  In most cases, they didn't even answer me.  In one only, <a href="https://roem.ru/">Roem</a> answered, saying that it was not interesting to anyone, although a year ago they published <a href="https://roem.ru/04-09-2013/138693/cian-vykatil-statistiku-cen-na-arendu-i-prodaju-kvartir/">something similar about Cyan</a> . <br><br>  So what we see in a situation when Yandex does the same thing?  The issue is replete with news about what a cool thing he did.  Everyone suddenly became interested.  And of course, there is no mention in any of the news that the same thing has already been done a year earlier on an unknown website. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pu/7-/tg/pu7-tguy3xe6yu_yi42ejnnz-8m.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/427961/">https://habr.com/ru/post/427961/</a></p>
