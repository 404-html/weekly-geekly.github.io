  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Will the super drones race be super sports?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Nowadays you will not surprise anyone with a miniature flying multi-screw device - or a drone.  Drones have already invented enough applications in military, industry, and transport.  But for the majority of their owners, they are, above all, a hobby, a hobby.  People who are enthusiastic, as you know, love to show off their offspring and be measured by their steepness.  All existing technical sports began sometime with a handful of enthusiasts.  Now we are watching the emergence of a new species - dronogonok.  Under the cut - the latest news from the fields of sports battles and a lot of interesting video. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b71/767/0a6/b717670a6bbc4dbe8a1a381c10be9b30.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Actually, in the competitions of drones there is no news either - there are now plenty of them among various categories of devices and according to different rules.  The question is, will they remain fun for fans or go to the masses, overgrown with fans and budgets?  Or, in another way, will Formula 1 drones ever appear?  Of course, we are not able to answer this question precisely, but there is some interesting movement about which we would like to tell. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Dtflr_4iYA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  On February 4, the first <a href="https://www.xclass.racing/">class X</a> drone <a href="https://www.meetup.com/X1-Drone-Racing/events/236381587/">races</a> took place in California.  This class includes devices with a frame length of 1 meter between engines (plus or minus 15 cm).  All other characteristics are not regulated.  Why was such a large size chosen?  The answer here is obvious: for more entertainment.  Large drone can be seen from afar, and it falls beautifully (where without it).  There are other reasons. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BZ8ZuYjqHa8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The larger the drone, the more powerful the engines on it can be put, the more hang the sensors and control electronics.  Continuing the comparison with the “Formula 1” in the X-class races, the main thing is speed.  Structurally, drones, like helicopters, are not inclined to rush at breakneck speed.  The more difficult their electronic filling must be in order to reach record levels.  In the near future, the creators of the super-drones - the conquest of the bar at 150 km / h. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8JSLxp5bqXI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  From a technical point of view, a specialized racing drone is an almost endless field for innovation and improvement.  It is no accident that Intel, who loves everything new and unexplored, is actively working in the field of unmanned flying devices.  So, at the end of last year, the company introduced the first commercial drone <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/intel-announces-commercial-drone-intel-falcon-8-system/">Intel Falcon 8+</a> .  But to the masses, the combination of “drones and Intel” is associated, probably, primarily with the light-music show performed by the Drone 100 devices - that video has become, one can say, viral. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eZ-js5zn-I0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Obviously (even “Formula 1” is not required to be remembered here) that this sport will be far from budget.  Able to show at least something racing drone is now estimated at $ 1000;  the upper limit, naturally, does not exist (just as the super-drone model produced in large quantities does not exist now, all the racing specimens are built on their own).  So much in the promotion of the project will depend on the commercial component.  And from the organization, of course.  Now the main driving force behind the X-class is the team of enthusiasts Team Vondrone from San Francisco, which has already built 4 class X aircraft. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/heu-J1ZXvcM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Meanwhile, on April 29, in the same place, in California, the second race of the season in the X class will be held. Participants plan to continue to set speed records there. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373383/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373383/</a></p>
