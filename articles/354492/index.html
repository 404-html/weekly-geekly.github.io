  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to develop a system that recognizes a person by keyboard writing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We are engaged in consumer lending online.  The issue of fraud prevention for us is one of the main issues.  Often potential fraudsters think that the security systems of fintech companies are lower than in traditional financial institutions.  But this is a myth.  It's exactly the opposite. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1v/3t/ri/1v3trilxw5xg0fuyh2s6hhxalgy.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  In order to nullify the level of potential fraud, we have developed a system of behavioral biometrics that is able to identify a person using keyboard handwriting.  The pilot version was introduced in Russia in August 2017. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  How it works </h3><br>  The system allows user authentication by the behavioral patterns peculiar to each person.  Among them: the speed and dynamics of typing, the transition time between the keys, typos and especially the movement of the mouse cursor over the screen.  As soon as a person registers in his personal account, the system analyzes his behavior and makes an impression, which is used for subsequent authentication on the site. <br><br>  The new program eliminates fraud.  If at the entrance to the personal account the user's handwriting does not coincide with the impression in the database, such a profile is entered in the list of risky ones that require additional verification.  Those.  if the system has reason to assume that the person is not the one for whom he claims to be, then we can request additional data or send this request for verification, where the living person will decide to approve or deny the loan. <br><br>  The peculiarity of the system is that the analyzed behavioral patterns cannot be faked: even if a person changes the keyboard, they may slightly change, but in the aggregate their structure will remain unchanged. <br><br><h3>  How to implement </h3><br>  The system was developed by the holding‚Äôs own forces on the basis of big data analysis technology.  The development and implementation of the program took about 4 weeks, the pilot lasted 6 months.  The accuracy of the pilot version of the biometric system was 97.6%.  The system is constantly being updated and filled with new data, which will increase the accuracy to the maximum size.  The biometric system formed the basis of fraud scoring ID Finance, which allows you to identify fraudsters.  Biometrics is used not only for authentication, but also for initial registration, when the client's handwriting is compared with all the nuggets in the database. <br><br><h3>  What got </h3><br>  Thanks to the antifraud-scoring system, it was possible to reduce the cost of a single issued loan by almost 25% by reducing the costs of verification and the cost of inquiries to sources of information.  The level of approval of applications increased by 28%.  The economic effect of the introduction is estimated at more than 90 million rubles.  in Russia according to the results of 2018. The economic effect only from the technology of keyboard handwriting recognition by the ID Finance group in seven countries is estimated at $ 2.8 million by the results of 2018 </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/354492/">https://habr.com/ru/post/354492/</a></p>
