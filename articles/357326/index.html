  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Evgeny Kaspersky can go on the settlement agreement with Microsoft</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/43c/334/2fa/43c3342fac617388d6a30e8b97ed40da.jpg"><br><br>  The head of "Kaspersky Lab" Eugene Kaspersky announced the suspension of the procedure for filing a complaint against Microsoft in the antitrust authorities of the European Union, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-kaspersky-microsoft-idUSKBN17R234">writes Reuters</a> .  This is a complaint about the specific features of the functioning of the Windows 10 operating system: Kaspersky states that when moving to Windows 10, the system removes all incompatible software from the previous OS version, including antivirus programs.  In other words, Windows 10 instead of any other antivirus installs its own anti-virus defender Defender. <br><br>  It is clear that antivirus companies are against this state of affairs.  Kaspersky Lab decided to file a complaint with Microsoft against anti-monopoly agents so that the Redmond company would change its OS settings to stop the removal of third-party anti-virus software.  According to the entrepreneur, Microsoft is ready to meet it and is already taking certain steps in this regard.  ‚ÄúThey listen to us and have already made a few changes.  This is a continuous process, ‚Äùsaid Kaspersky.  He also said that if Microsoft corrects everything that is stated in the complaint, there will be no legal process. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  By the way, the very consideration of the case, which should be considered by the Federal Antimonopoly Service, is postponed for the third time.  Now consideration is scheduled for June 2.  At the meeting, the FAS will examine the signs of abuse of a dominant position in the Russian market, RIA Novosti reports.  Initially, the examination of the case was essentially scheduled for December 20, when the first meeting took place.  The second was appointed on February 14, later it was postponed to April 21.  FAS then announced that the case was postponed, and the new date of the meeting was not appointed. <br><br>  As for the substance <a href="https://eugene.kaspersky.ru/2016/11/10/s-menya-xvatit/">of</a> Kaspersky‚Äôs <a href="https://eugene.kaspersky.ru/2016/11/10/s-menya-xvatit/">claims</a> against Microsoft, the main problem is the reduction in the time when third-party virus software adapts to the Windows 10 operating system. According to representatives of the antivirus manufacturer, Microsoft has reduced the time to adapt antivirus software from 2 months to 6 calendar days.  And this, according to Kaspersky Lab, gives Microsoft unjustified advantages in the software market. <br><br>  According to the head of the FAS, Igor Artemyev, it takes about six months to conclude the case of the American corporation.  The length of the process, he said, will depend on the evidence base.  Kaspersky himself argues that if the court begins, the process in this case may take several years.  "Microsoft is undermining the trust of users in Microsoft: creating the illusion of security, the company destroys the advantage of its platform - openness and democracy," said the head of Kaspersky Lab.  A similar complaint, if Microsoft refuses to fulfill the requirements of Kaspersky, the company will send to the European Commission. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/357326/">https://habr.com/ru/post/357326/</a></p>
