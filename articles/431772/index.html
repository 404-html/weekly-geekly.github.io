To do this, I created test invoices in my PayPal account and accidentally made one to sds@gmail.com.  I did and thought hardly anyone had such a short address and continued to struggle with hooks that have not earned so far.  But what was my surprise when I noticed in my list of activities in PayPal that the same test invoice acquired a name ... <br><a name="habracut"></a>  Ivan Sereda. <br>  It became interesting to me and out of curiosity I tried to learn more about this interesting person.  Which perhaps stood at the origins of Google.  From the search engines it was not possible to find anything; unfortunately, the first and last names were the same as the famous war hero. <br><br>  But then it became interesting for me to break through even more beautiful emails in a similar way and it turned out that for example abc@gmail.com belongs to Abdul Jabbar, a@gmail.com -&gt; Ads Sdf, b@gmail.com -&gt; Galgla Galgal and i @ gmail. com -&gt; Maria Victoria de la Puente, g@gmail.com -&gt; aa, i@hotmail.com -&gt; Sevgi tertemiz, etc. and so on. <br>  Of course, one and a half of them do not sound realistic, for some invoices I received such notices as ‚ÄúYour invoice to Maria Victoria de la Puente wasn't delivered‚Äù.  What is strange: paper knows and gave me the name, but I could not deliver the bill.  It turns out that the old paper, as a cherry on the cake, out of the goodness of his heart, checked these beautiful addresses for viability to receive mail.  Perhaps because of their former beauty and excessive popularity, most of them are now abandoned.  But the very hole in the privacy of the data fascinated me and I tried the phone numbers and it also worked ... <br>  Then it became too lazy to do it manually.  Of course, using the API, you can create many, many requests to PayPal and find out many, many real names of people with paper accounts not only from Gmail.  Of course, paper issued data name that they themselves entered users.  Although many introduce real ones because the delivery of the paid goods and any authorization is based on them and they must be registered in the paper. <br>  But it turned out that in a similar way it is possible to pierce the name with the number of bodies, as now the paper is binding the accounts to the numbers of mobile phones. <br>  I alone think that this is a hole or a button accordion, and so it should be? <br><br>  PS: if someone from the readers could help with the settings of the long-suffering hooks it would be great ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/431772/">https://habr.com/ru/post/431772/</a></p>
