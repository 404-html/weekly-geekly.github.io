  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sales of plug-in electric vehicles in the USA (with charts): October 2018</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last month, there were no records, but the growth is still impressive. <br><br>  According to our calculations, sales of connected electric vehicles in October were at a good level, the approximate figures are as follows: 34,094 passenger cars were sold, an annual growth of 138% (year to year / as compared to October 2017 / year). <br><br>  There were no chances to beat the record sales of the month of September 2018 ( <a href="https://insideevs.com/us-plug-in-electric-car-sales-charted-september-2018/">more than 44 thousand</a> ), but this is not the goal (due to the peculiarities of sales for individual months). <br><br>  The most important conclusion is that the growth rate accelerated from 110% in September to 138% in October (in annual terms). <br><br>  Sales of plug-in electric vehicles in October amounted to about 2.5% (2nd place, 1st place - 3.1% - September 2018). <br><br>  <i>Sales of plug-in electric vehicles in the USA</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/30f/a44/606/30fa446064edd0de0ef2883e5e13bfa5.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f65/a3d/497/f65a3d4979ee3624d66d1ace8f5cafac.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Total sales in the first 10 months of this year amounted to 268,729 connected electric vehicles (1.9% of the total market). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/451/d31/b52/451d31b523ea8549904427e77c747756.png" alt="image"><br><br>  There was a lot of talk about how Tesla poorly copes with production hell in 2017 and 2018, however, look at the sales results of Model 3 compared to other electric vehicles. <br><br>  <i>10 best-selling plug-in electric vehicles in the United States in January-October 2018.</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bf4/e4f/867/bf4e4f867395defd5b38e49e6677b21f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Currently, Model 3 accounts for almost 36% of all sales of plug-in electric vehicles in the US market, and along with two other models Model S / X, Tesla occupies almost 50% of the market (for the first 10 months of this year). <br><br>  <i>Sales of Model 3 in the USA (calculated)</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bf6/cad/5ca/bf6cad5ca9dcf148cb96014debf496c8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In October, according to total sales, the Tesla Model 3 bypassed the Toyota Prius Prime (2 generations), and the Nissan LEAF - will be completed in the next 2 months.  On the other hand, the Tesla Model X caught up with Ford Fusion Energi. <br><br>  <i>10 best-selling plug-in electric vehicles in the United States (total sales for all time)</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eab/fa0/531/eabfa0531e9725672e492f48e3624a4e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And finally, the graph below shows <a href="https://insideevs.com/top-6-automakers-200000-federal-tax-credit-limit/">sales of plug-in electric vehicles in the United States by manufacturers</a> who are close to losing federal tax refunds (Tesla has overcome this barrier, and is now at the stage of phasing out these returns). <br>  General Motors will sell its 200 thousand (two hundred thousandth) plug-in electric car in December of this year.  Perhaps, as in the case of Tesla, this figure will be reached a month later than expected. <br>  A more favorable outcome for General Motors is the sale of two hundred thousandth connected electric vehicles in January than in December, since tax refunds will last for another 3 months in full in the 1st quarter (7.5 thousand US dollars) than the situation when full refund will be available only on the last few days of the month and the quarter as a whole. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/562/79d/a4a/56279da4a9b16e6b3c391d97737c1816.png" alt="image"><br><br>  * Update <br>  A plug-in electric car (this is any vehicle that can be charged from an external source of electricity) is an electric car with a battery, plug-in hybrid. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/429798/">https://habr.com/ru/post/429798/</a></p>
