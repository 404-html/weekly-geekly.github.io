With the help of its partners, Y Combinator organizes meetings with entrepreneurs in our country and the selection of young projects. <br><br>  In Moscow, opens a new coworking Yellow Door.  Meetings with representatives and partners of Y Combinator are timed to its opening.  Yellow Door in Moscow was opened by the company <a href="http://www.i8ga.com/">Innov8 Global Advisory / Ventures / Labs</a> .  One of its goals is to support promising IT projects from Russia and their entry into the American market. <br><br>  January 15 in coworking will be the first meeting.  It will host a teleconference with Y Combinator partner Kat Manalak (also co-founder of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit">Reddit</a> and former brand strategist at <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired">WIRED</a> magazine).  The meeting will be moderated by Val Zherdes, partner of Innov8 Global Advisory / Ventures / Labs.  He is also a co-founder of the Skolkovo Seed Investment Fund. <br><br>  The organizers promise that the event will cover, among other things, the aspects of applying to Y Combinator, and participants will have the opportunity to ask their questions to the partners of the accelerator. <a name="habracut"></a>  All communication will take place in English.  Participation is free, the number of tickets is limited;  You can register <a href="https://yellowdoor-events.timepad.ru/event/282292/">here</a> . <br><br>  The second meeting will be held on February 2.  It will be held in a closed session format.  The 6 selected teams will have the opportunity to present their projects to Y Combinator partners and receive advice and recommendations from them.  The selection of applications for participation in the prepitch-session Y Combinator is already closed, but you can sign up on the waiting list. <br><br>  Ivan Drobyshev from Grechka Communications agency, which represents the Yellow Door, <a href="http://rusbase.com/news/y-combinator-moscow/">told</a> Rusbase that there was no public recruitment: ‚ÄúThese are startups that were selected by Innov8 personally.  But there is a chance to get extra if you send an application. ‚Äù <br><br>  At the meeting on February 2, Y Combinator partners will be present remotely in a tele-bridge format, however, some business angels from Russia and Silicon Valley will indeed arrive at Moscow pitches.  In the future, he said, other similar meetings with other funds from Silicon Valley will be organized. <br><br>  Y Combinator is an acceleration program, startups such as <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb">Airbnb</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropbox">Dropbox</a> , Reddit and many others have passed through it.  Y Combinator holds two three-month funding cycles per year, during which they work with the founders, help them find investors, and also invest up to $ 120 thousand in exchange for 7% of the company. <br><br>  In addition to the American accelerator, the Skolkovo business school <a href="http://rusbase.com/news/shkola-granti/">continues</a> to help Russian startups.  The Moscow School of Management Skolkovo, in partnership with the Zimin Foundation, is launching an educational grants competition for start-up entrepreneurs.  The winners will have the opportunity to receive training in the <a href="https://startup.skolkovo.ru/ru/ssa/about/">Startup Academy</a> acceleration program. <br><br>  And the company GVA LaunchGurus <a href="http://rusbase.com/news/gva-kurs/">organizes an</a> educational program for beginners and practicing business angels <a href="http://gvalaunch.guru/events/b443467f">VC Bootcamp</a> , during which participants will be told about the various nuances of venture capital investments.  So, promising Russian startups are still needed both in our country and abroad. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297876/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297876/</a></p>
