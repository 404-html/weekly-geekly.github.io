Review of the book ‚ÄúDiscovering the Future Organizations‚Äù by Frederick Lalu</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b40/baf/7df/b40baf7df05248a898560597c43229e6.png" alt="image"><br>  This is a delight! <br>  A study that strikes from start to finish.  You may be in something disagree or, on the contrary, agree on everything, but in any case it should be read. <br><br>  These are questions that have been troubling many people for a long time.  Is it possible to organize a company so that all employees are happy at work?  Is it possible to get rid of the stereotypical thinking that the work of the word slave?  How to get rid of the endless bureaucracy, which devours companies, should they grow to 50+ people? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The author conducted an extraordinary study.  Having visited many organizations around the world, combining the work of his predecessors, he developed criteria by which it is possible to distinguish "turquoise" organizations. <br><br>  These are innovative companies whose leaders took the risk and were right.  They believed that the majority of people are not lazy and stupid, but purposeful and smart, if together with employees to work out a goal that will be close to everyone, then such a company will reach incredible heights.  These people do not need tight control, they organize themselves, they will undertake obligations themselves and fulfill them by all means.  Employees need not be managed, they need help, suggest processes that will help them solve conflicts and make decisions, clear the way for them among possible obstacles related to investor relations and the board of directors. <br><br>  The companies that Lalu researched are very different in size: from a few dozen people to tens of thousands in the field of activity: from helping patients at home to building power plants or producing tomato paste.  These companies did not know about each other, but at the same time they came to the same conclusions, they organized the work in approximately the same way.  All of them are united by the absence of a rigid structure of subordination and the central apparatus, even the CEOs in these companies do not have special power, they are equal to their colleagues.  Someone will say that this is chaos, but experience shows that this is the next stage of development. <br><br>  At the end of his book, the author dreams of a "turquoise" world of the future.  I do not know whether he is right or not, wait and see.  But the fact that such thoughts do not just come to mind, but also find confirmation in the real world, in real companies, it really gives great hopes. <br><br>  I strongly recommend reading this book to anyone who cares.  And those who still agree with the author and want to act - for them at the end of the book there are tips on how to start rebuilding their company in order to reach a new level of development and, possibly, change the world. <br><br>  <b>Book:</b> Discovering the Future Organizations <br>  <b>By:</b> Frederick Lalu <br>  <b>Publisher:</b> <a href="http://www.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/books/novyj-vzglyad-na-organizacii/">Mann, Ivanov and Ferber</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297242/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297242/</a></p>
