But I will ask readers to go through memory and apply it in life, and I‚Äôm ready to argue, you won‚Äôt find a case where the principle wouldn‚Äôt work, no matter how good or bad you think it was the act of another person. </p><br><p>  However, it is worth saying that a more correct formulation includes only one person, since the group‚Äôs behavior is a combinatorial explosion, and it is more difficult to analyze it. </p><br><blockquote>  A person does what he thinks is the best at the moment. </blockquote><p>  Understanding this principle can greatly help with reacting to chaos around you (work and personal life) and planning your actions, taking into account others. <del>  players </del>  humans, it is in some form, a simplification of game theory. </p><br><p>  Meta: The post you are reading falls under the same principle, and that's fine. </p></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/427917/">https://habr.com/ru/post/427917/</a></p>
