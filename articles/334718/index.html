More than 8,000 students registered for it.  And it inspired us to create a full-fledged specialization "Interface Designer", consisting of five courses and the protection of the graduation project.  The program is suitable for both beginners and qualified UI-and UX-specialists.  During training, a student can reach a middle-level level in interface design from scratch. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  <strong>In the first year,</strong> students will learn the principles of designing user interaction, learn the basic concepts of visual design, learn to distinguish good design from bad and analyze current trends.  Already during training, they will begin to apply the laws of product design in practice and will be able to solve some of these interface tasks. </p><br><p>  <strong>In the second year,</strong> students will go all the way to creating an interface concept: from getting a task to thinking through an information architecture and a paper interface prototype. </p><br><p>  <strong>In the third year,</strong> students will work on the visual language of the interface.  Creative directors from product teams and design studios will share their experience working on design concepts.  In addition, students will develop an animated interactive interface prototype. </p><br><p>  <strong>The fourth course</strong> will give a quick immersion in the design of mobile interfaces.  Students will learn the specifics of design for iOS and Android and will go through an already familiar design process, but from the point of view of the agency that deals with the mobile development of interfaces. </p><br><p>  <strong>The fifth course</strong> is aimed at developing the personal qualities needed by the designer: teamwork, project management, leadership skills.  Students will learn how different design teams function, what are the roles and areas of responsibility.  We will tell about employment from the point of view of employers.  Students will understand what expectations and requirements employers have and decide in which direction they want to develop and grow professionally. </p><br><p>  As a graduation project, students will create a prototype interface and a presentation describing the project.  This case will be an excellent addition to the portfolio and will be an advantage over customers and employers.  In addition, during the training there will be about 15 practical tasks, the results of which can also be put in the portfolio. </p><br><p>  Graduates who have successfully completed all the courses, have done a thesis and received a certificate will have access to the employment program from Contented. </p><br><p>  The set to the first thread will close on August 7, and the next will open every two weeks.  After registration, the student will get access to a free test week of study.  After its completion, the user can pay for the full training program. </p><br><p>  Register for specialization <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ux-ui-design">here</a> . </p></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/334718/">https://habr.com/ru/post/334718/</a></p>
