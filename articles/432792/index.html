  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Roskomnadzor fined Google 500 thousand rubles</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Google Corporation was fined 500 thousand rubles for failure to comply with Russian legislation, as <a href="https://tass.ru/ekonomika/5897468">reported by</a> TASS.  The first of the fine imposed was the head of Roskomnadzor, Alexander Zharov.  He added that the agency plans to monitor the company for compliance with the legislation of the Russian Federation. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe will continue to seek compliance with Russian legislation.  I can announce that in the near future we will start the next administrative case against Google, ‚Äùhe said. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The reason for the penalty is not connecting Google to FGIS with the list of sites blocked in Russia.  In November, this was the reason for drawing up a protocol on an administrative offense, with further collection of a fine.  Roskomnadzor <a href="https://habr.com/post/428636/">said</a> that Google was notified of the need to connect to the registry a few months ago.  Then the service turned to the Russian division of the search engine, as well as its headquarters.  But the reminder did not give any results. <br><br>  According to the requirements of the agency, search engine operators should exclude links to resources with illegal information from the results of search results.  To do this, they must connect to the federal state information system, which contains a list of prohibited Internet resources. <br><br>  Roskomnadzor <a href="https://habr.com/post/429926/">held a</a> special meeting with Google representatives, at which one of the corporation‚Äôs managers declared agreement to follow the law.  At the end of November, Google representatives were present at the drafting of an administrative offense report; the company did not admit guilt. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/432792/">https://habr.com/ru/post/432792/</a></p>
