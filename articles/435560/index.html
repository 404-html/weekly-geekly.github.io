Iron is self-calibrating and optimized for cryogenic conditions, these measures are necessary to reduce the number of errors.  In addition, the computer has its own high-performance cryogenic system, and according to IBM, it is permissible to carry out diagnostics, maintenance and even system upgrades without shutting it down, while preserving the user experience. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jq/23/ea/jq23eauvyuikg6tcdk-jdokllgo.png" alt="image"><br><br>  An important feature on which the manufacturer focuses attention is the built-in functionality for connecting a quantum computer to the cloud system.  Thus, there is a functional transition from specialized quantum systems on a chip, used for experimental purposes, to the full integration of quantum computing for user systems and business needs. <br><br>  In order to develop a quantum computing ecosystem, IBM also announced the creation of a consortium with ExxonMobil, the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) and Fermilab, to search for the maximum number of tasks in which the use of such integrated quantum systems would be efficient.  This group of organizations is not closed and an invitation to cooperate for other interested parties has already been announced. <br><br>  In the second half of 2019, in the city of Poughkeepsie (English Poughkeepsie) of the State of New York, IBM plans to open the IBM Q Quantum Computation Center, which will act as the headquarters for the development of complex integrated quantum systems and facilitate their practical implementation. <br><br>  It is worth noting that the design of the system is made by several well-known studios and is amazingly beautiful for such a utilitarian device.  In many ways, there is continuity with the first commercial supercomputer Cray-1.  Both in form (albeit mirror-inverted) and in size, as well as in terms of the use of glass. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m1/ks/bm/m1ksbmxrfk41i88jublwhspptlo.png" alt="image"><br><br>  At the time of writing, the IBM website with the promo section of a quantum computer was not available. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/435560/">https://habr.com/ru/post/435560/</a></p>
