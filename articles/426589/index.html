Its essence is the launch of an unmanned taxi on the territory of the innovation center.  The agreement has already been signed by Yelena Bunina, CEO of Yandex, and Igor Drozdov, chairman of the board of the foundation, as <a href="https://tass.ru/ekonomika/5678388">reported by</a> TASS. <br><br>  The project consists of several stages.  At the first stage, the unmanned taxi will be available only to residents of the innovation center, who will give their consent to participate in the testing of the mobile.  You can order an unmanned vehicle through the Yandex.Taxi application.  The press service of the transport division of "Yandex" indicated that travel within the pilot project will be completely free for passengers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúThis is the first step towards making unmanned vehicles mass urban transport, an everyday phenomenon of everyday life,‚Äù said representatives of Yandex.  The company also noticed that technology without any problems allows robotaxi to follow the rules of the road, in addition, you can monitor the situation on the roads. <br><br>  Work on the technology for an unmanned vehicle has been underway since 2016, it uses various ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù developments from areas such as machine learning, computer vision and navigation.  In June 2017, the company conducted a closed unmanned vehicle test.  Then, two prototypes took part in the test, each of which had sensors and specialized software installed.  Sensors collect information about the condition of the vehicle and the environment, and specialized software determines how the machine should move after analyzing the information received from the sensors. <br><br>  The hardware and software system allows you to go independently along a predetermined route, and in the case of obstacles, go around them.  Robotics are able to identify and drive around, including other cars and people.  If the obstacle cannot be overrun, the robotaxi stops. <br><br>  In February 2018, the drone from ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù drove through the streets of Moscow after a snowfall, in June the rover mobile successfully covered a distance of 789 km, traveling from Moscow to Kazan. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/426589/">https://habr.com/ru/post/426589/</a></p>
