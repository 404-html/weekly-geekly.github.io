  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Who are the organizers of peer events</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/listpr/blog/19966/">last publication,</a> we described what ‚Äúmutual cooperation‚Äù is and why with its help in just a few days almost any email distribution author can effectively replenish their base with new target subscribers. <br><br>  At the moment, there are a huge number of organizers of peer-to-peer events.  We decided to distribute a little the organizers of peer relations to us invented conditional groups. <br><br>  To begin with, let's <b>see what should be included in the basic functions of the mutual relations organizer</b> : <a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  Communication with the participants of the event.  Without proper accompaniment of participants, the event runs the risk of failing; </li><li>  Collection of necessary information regarding the advertising blocks of the participants; </li><li>  Creation and design of the page of the mutual event, which will have high conversion rates for transitions; </li><li>  Preparation of texts of letters for distribution by participants of events; </li><li>  Control indicators when sending event participants letters to their email databases; </li><li>  Work with unscrupulous participants and substandard mailings; </li><li>  Formation of individual statistics for each participant in real time; </li><li>  Maximum automation and comfortable working conditions.  The participant should not suffer every time filling in the same type of information and report on each step. </li></ul><br>  Here is the minimum functionality that our <a href="http://listpr.com/">ListPR.com</a> service <a href="http://listpr.com/">provides</a> and which is simply obliged to provide by any competent event organizer of the mutual media. <br><br>  We now turn to the classification of the organizers.  Conventionally, the organizers can be divided into those who perform the necessary actions in manual mode and those who work in automatic or semi-automatic mode. <br><br>  <b>The first group</b> is individuals who do everything with their hands, often the quality of their work suffers, the actions are not always effective, in full and correct.  With such organizers, event participants may not be protected from unprincipled counterparts.  Often, due to the ‚Äúmanual‚Äù organization and holding of events, the organizers do not even take half of the necessary actions.  Such an approach to conducting mutual relations is not technological and often looks ‚Äúhandicraft‚Äù.  We can not fail to note that among such ‚Äútame‚Äù organizers there are sometimes decent people. <br><br>  <b>The second group</b> is services, some of which have gone many steps forward from the organizers of the first group.  Services operate in semi-automatic or fully automatic mode.  The logic of work of different services differs from each other.  Also, as among the organizers of the first group, there are inefficient and ‚Äúhandicraft‚Äù services with extremely narrow tools.  Often, the logic of unfair services is reduced to solving the questions of owners of such services in promoting their email databases and products. <br><br>  We wish you to meet on your way only conscientious and professional organizers of mutual funds.  Choose the best! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295136/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295136/</a></p>
