At the same time there were no incidents with Tesla.  In general, on this very stretch of the road more than 200 Tesla passes daily with the autopilot on. </li><li>  The accident is so difficult because the bump stop - a construction that softens the blow - was either simply in a “folded” state, or “formed” as a result of a previous incident and was not replaced with a new one after that.  Tesla employees have never seen so much damage to Model X as a result of an accident. </li><li>  The vehicle battery is designed to minimize the chance of fire.  If it occurs, it spreads slowly so that passengers have time to leave the car.  According to the witnesses, no one was in the car by the time the fire was dangerous.  Such a serious accident can lead to a fire in any type of car and Tesla data collected over billions of miles suggests that a fire in a car with ICE is five times more likely than in a Tesla car (US data). </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0q/ig/qc/0qigqceg2psmtcbo39sukp-xpiw.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ws/kv/ck/wskvckqggexfpre-3kq6yvhu-bm.png"><br><br>  Also, it is worth noting that an independent study conducted by a commission from the US government more than a year ago found out that the Tesla autopilot reduces the probability of an accident by 40% and since then the autopilot has continued to improve.  Of course, this does not mean that he can prevent all possible incidents - this is impossible - but thanks to him they happen less often. <br><br>  <b>My findings</b> <br><br>  The autopilot, most likely, was not included at the time of the accident, or is it some kind of the latest firmware version (started to be delivered quite recently), for which not enough statistics have been collected yet, or this time this unique situation has developed with which autopilot he could not handle. <br><br>  The death of the driver is not related to the action of fire on the car battery, but it can still be associated with burning poisoning. <br><br>  Death could probably have been avoided if the bump was in good condition. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/411125/">https://habr.com/ru/post/411125/</a></p>
