For SimpleAir, this case was one of the most notorious - the patent troll accused Google of violating technology to display push notifications on Android smartphones that were registered Behind him as part of a patent in the United States under the number US7035914 B1. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Now, Google was able to prove the illegality of this decision, winning the appeal on the case last Friday.  As part of the trial, the US Court of Appeals proved that the judge misinterpreted the SimpleAir patent, which is in no way related to the push message technology used in Android. <br><br>  The decision of the court confirms in part that, despite the active use of patents against large companies, now the patent trolls are less likely to receive any deductions. <br><br>  It is noteworthy that SimpleAir has already filed a second lawsuit against Google in 2014 using a similar patent and total damage of more than $ 100 million. At that time, the court recognized the absence of any violations by Google. <br><br>  The owner of SimpleAir and the former head of Stamps.com, John Payne, is also the owner of the patent <a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US7035914">US7035914 B1</a> , registered in 1996, when he headed AirMedia.  At that time, AirMedia was engaged in delivering content to personal computers. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúYou can even pay a little more and receive notifications about new messages coming in the mail via AirMedia,‚Äù explained PC Magazine of AirMedia, which won the 1997 edition of the magazine, for work. </blockquote><br>  In those years, the Internet speed left much to be desired and AirMedia used a wireless connection, for which it was necessary to purchase a NewsCatcher router and an AirMedia subscription.  The cheapest version of the subscription cost $ 24.95 per year, but there were also advanced options with additional options.  But with the growing popularity of Wi-Fi technology, AirMedia became less and less popular, and as a result, the company went bankrupt in 1999.  Based on AirMedia patents in 2014, they created the SimpleAir patent patent troll, which earns exclusively on ships with large companies. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299916/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299916/</a></p>
