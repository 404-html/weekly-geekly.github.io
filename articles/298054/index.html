Moreover, the CEO and President of News Media publishing house, Aram Gabrelyanov, also talks about changing priorities within the holding and targeting the Internet. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Gabrelyanov said that the new portal Life.ru will have several sections: in addition to news and articles on politics, business and economics, the site will also include topics that highlight social life.  In addition, viral content will be posted on the portal (i.e. any nonsense that the entire Internet loves).  He says about the new project as follows: ‚ÄúThis will be a huge portal about life - if you take Western counterparts, something like Buzzfeed‚Äù. <br><br>  Gabrelyanov argues that the new project will not require large capital investments and large-scale recruitment of staff, since the existing resources within the holding will be redistributed to create it.  Part of the staff will go to the portal from the already existing newspaper Izvestia and the LifeNews and Super.ru portals.  However, at the moment there is no exact plan for personnel changes. <br><br>  It also remains unclear who will lead the portal Life.ru.  Rumor has it that the head of the newspaper "Izvestia" Alexander Potapov is considered the candidate for this position. <br><br>  It is assumed that 15 regional versions of the site will be created on the basis of the correspondent points of the News Media holding company, which are currently working with the LifeNews portal and Izvestia.  It is planned to be among the first to launch versions of the site for Novosibirsk and Yekaterinburg. <br><br>  Gabrelyanov also said that the policy of the holding will change: ‚ÄúA year ago we decided that we would focus more on the Internet.  In fact, before we had the main TV - LifeNews.  Now the main thing will be Life.ru, and the channel will be like an attachment to it. ‚Äù <br><br>  Deputy General Director of Rambler &amp; Co Maxim Tadevosyan commented on the emergence of a new portal as follows: ‚ÄúProbably, there is another task that does not apply to commercial ones.  For example, translate "Izvestia" in digital format (since the paper is also experiencing hard times) and by posting on a single portal with strong assets like LifeNews, strengthen the newspaper‚Äôs position on the Internet. " <br><br>  Note that the former executive director of the original BuzzFeed, John Steinberg, is also working on a new project.  This time he plans to launch a video news portal.  And he has already hired the first employee of his startup: Peter Gorenstei (Peter Gorenstei), who previously holds the position of senior executive producer at Yahoo!  Studios. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298054/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298054/</a></p>
