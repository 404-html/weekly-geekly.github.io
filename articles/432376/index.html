  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tinkoff Bank has developed a male voice assistant named Oleg or Ivan</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Oleg Tinkov, founder and chairman of the bank‚Äôs board of directors at Tinkoff Bank‚Äôs employees, announced yesterday that the company had developed a voice assistant who can communicate with users in natural language, almost like Alice from Yandex, Vedomosti reports.  The official presentation will take place in a week. <br><br>  ‚ÄúSo far, very modestly, we decided to name‚Äú Oleg ‚Äù.  But maybe we'll change it again, maybe we'll call it Ivan, ‚ÄùTinkov said at corporate party, answering the question of Ivan Urgant. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Oleg Tinkov did not explain why the name ‚ÄúOleg‚Äù was chosen, but said that this choice was ‚Äúpainfully long‚Äù.  The businessman did not disclose the technical features of the voice assistant, they will be disclosed at the official presentation.  But the system demonstrated in the work.  One of the corporate party participants <a href="https://vedomosti.media.eagleplatform.com/index/player%3Fplayer%3Dnew%26player_template_id%3D5332%26record_id%3D1171376">made a video of</a> how the AI ‚Äã‚Äãreserves a table in a restaurant for Oleg Tinkov, talks to the owner and asks for what date the reservation is needed. <br><br>  Oleg will be built into the bank‚Äôs mobile application to help users with their financial and everyday tasks.  For example, a robot will help buy tickets to the cinema or theater, transfer money from one account to another, etc. <br><br>  In addition to Oleg and Alice, another voice assistant Marusya, which is developed by Mail.ru Group, will soon appear on the market.  These are fully-fledged AI agents that can communicate on a wide range of topics and perform a large list of tasks.  There are still limited virtual assistants, like Elena from MegaFon: she knows only a limited amount of information.  For example, Elena can suggest a balance or remnants of minutes and megabytes, talk about expenses and payment methods. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/432376/">https://habr.com/ru/post/432376/</a></p>
