  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IBM opens ultramodern client center in Moscow</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://www.twilio.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ibm-logo-800px-640x265.jpg" width="644"><br><br>  IBM has announced the opening of an ultra-modern client center in Moscow.  Using analytics, cloud and mobile technologies, as well as social interaction tools, IBM specialists can help customers solve various business problems. <br><br>  According to the plan, the new center will provide customers with free access to the capabilities of various technologies and innovative developments of IBM.  The client center will be the ideal platform for meetings of customers and business partners with IBM experts to share knowledge, experience and advanced ideas. <br><br>  Speaking at the opening of the client center, Kirill Kornilyev, General Director of IBM in Russia and the CIS, said that ‚Äúin the center, each customer can not only get valuable information to solve various business problems, but also look into the future, work closely with experts from IBM and discover all the IBM tools that can help him carry out a successful business transformation. ‚Äù <br><br>  He also added that ‚Äúthe key task is to actively engage and build stronger partnerships with our customers.  Within the framework of such a model of cooperation, the center will prepare a whole set of concrete measures with clear business results, and not just scattered presentations. ‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The IBM client center will become a platform for industry briefings, demonstrations of new solutions, presentations, seminars. <br><br><img src="http://www.hok.com/uploads/2012/05/09/ibm-forumimage6.jpg" width="644"><br>  <i>This is what the company's client center in London looks like.</i>  <i>About the same center opened in Moscow</i> <br><br>  The client center has a demo zone that uses a wide range of digital technology capabilities to showcase industry solutions for the government and banking sector, insurance, tourism, transport, natural resources, energy and utilities, and retail.  The solutions available at the center cover a wide range of issues that meet the needs of each customer, in particular, improving the quality control of the technological process, situational management (for operational centers), improving the traffic management system, increasing sales for marketing professionals, more efficient management brand and customer loyalty and retention programs, helping risk management consultants to counter money laundering and mosh control  investment <br><br>  ‚ÄúFor example, if a client during a visit to the center wants to familiarize himself with a solution with which you can manage all the operations of the water supply system, IBM experts will demonstrate a prototype of such a solution with the ability to monitor equipment condition and predict the main reasons for emergency shutdowns by analyzing various parameters.  In addition, the demo will present the possibilities of creating a unified control center for disparate dispatch services on the territory of one enterprise, as well as solutions to help operators optimize resources and manage local events in an open operating environment.  Such solutions can be implemented both at the level of urban and regional water supply systems, ‚Äùsays Maxim Silver, head of the IBM client center. <br><br>  The client center has its own data center and is equipped with a modern audio and video subsystem. <br>  The new office in Moscow will be part of an extensive network of more than 50 IBM client centers around the world, supporting the entire range of the company's products and solutions and providing customers with access to IBM's global capabilities, experience and expertise. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365547/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365547/</a></p>
