The basic idea that underlies this idea is that its own Internet, which does not depend on external players, is protected from outside interference.  Therefore, if someone out there decides to disconnect the country from the Network, it will have its own, and there will be no problems. <br><br>  As it turned out, the citizens of the country perceive this idea with enthusiasm.  Thus, almost 60% of Russians supported the proposal of the RF Security Council on an independent Internet within the BRICS member countries.  This is evidenced by <a href="https://wciom.ru/index.php%3Fid%3D236%26uid%3D116657">data from a survey of the</a> All-Russian Center for the Study of Public Opinion (VTsIOM), available at RIA Novosti. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  “Russia's proposal to create an independent Internet within the borders of the BRICS member countries was supported by 58% of our fellow citizens (29% were against),” the report says. <br><br>  Half of the respondents believe that the creation of their own Internet by the BRICS countries will increase the level of data security for Russians.  This opinion is held by 49% of respondents.  Plus, about the same number believe that such a network would be the best defense against international hacker attacks.  Approximately 41% think that if this initiative is implemented, access to external resources will be limited. <br><br>  “It is extremely interesting that in our society the value of the Internet as a global information space is gradually reevaluated: in 2000, almost two thirds of citizens (64%) believed that its development is useful for our society, in 2018 there were less than half “46%,” the study authors say. <br><br>  About 52% of Russians claim that the development of the Internet as a global space is beneficial for society.  “13% were in favor of creating the Internet within the borders of several states.  In addition to its neighbors - Belarus and Kazakhstan, China is considered to be one of Russia's main partners in this business.  About a quarter (23%) would prefer to have local Internet within our country, ”the study notes. <br><br>  Interestingly, about a quarter of surveyed survey participants stated that they would prefer to have local Internet within the country. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/356262/">https://habr.com/ru/post/356262/</a></p>
