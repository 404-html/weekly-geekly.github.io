  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Some useful improvements in the company profile on ‚ÄúMy Circle‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Everyone already knows how important the HR-brand is for companies: the image of a good employer helps to find the necessary specialists for the company faster and cheaper and to keep them longer, better motivated and get more valuable results from their work. <br><br>  Therefore, it is important for us, at <a href="http://moikrug.ru/">My Circle</a> , to help companies as best as possible disclose themselves as employers for potential applicants.  Following this principle, we have added a few more useful improvements on company profiles, and today we want to talk about them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/735/4fe/b2b/7354feb2b5cf43ed91bb6692dd2cb930.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The picture shows the profiles of companies: <a href="https://moikrug.ru/companies/avito">Avito</a> and <a href="https://moikrug.ru/companies/skbkontur">SKB Kontur</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of all, <b>we showed the "technological stack" of the company</b> .  That is, a list of the most popular, according to our information, in the company of skills.  This list is made up of the skills of all current employees of the company, as well as of the company's vacancies, placed by it on My Circle over the past year.  According to this list, it will be easier for a potential applicant to understand what technologies he will face if he comes to work in the company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/8bb/abf/1c3/8bbabf1c3dd741b09f9a78bbe6914c57.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Then, <b>we brought a block with information about current and past employees of the</b> company, again, focusing on the data that users of "My circle" leave about themselves on the service.  From the block you can go to the search results by specialists and see their full lists.  Thus, a potential applicant will be able to get acquainted with his future colleagues, with their experience and skills. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/8ee/60c/52f/8ee60c52fa584b4a9fdfdc5ab8e9296e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Finally, we explicitly added a <b>block that the company maintains its blog on Habrahabr</b> .  In the block, we show the number of subscribers and publications of the company, as well as 5 hubs in which the company has the most publications.  This block is displayed in those companies that have indicated a link to their blog in their settings on My Circle.  Knowing what and how the company speaks with developers, it is much easier to make a decision about working in it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/02c/1eb/2ff/02c1eb2ffca74388b6856a184820b8e9.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="https://moikrug.ru/companies">In the search for companies,</a> you can now search for companies not only by field of activity, city or name, but also by skills.  Each company in search results now has a list of its most popular skills.  You can also separately display all companies that have a blog on Habr√©.  Such companies on the list are marked with a special icon. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/5d0/287/638/5d0287638bf749d5ae14ee6d27358889.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/336884/">https://habr.com/ru/post/336884/</a></p>
