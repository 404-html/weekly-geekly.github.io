  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Facebook for the first time closed access to some publications for Russian IP-addresses.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Facebook complied with the decision of the Tushinsky District Court of Moscow and hid a number of publications on Facebook and Instagram from Russian users.  This is the first time that Facebook executes decisions of Russian courts, Kommersant <a href="https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3811577">writes</a> .  In this case, we are talking about a number of publications discrediting the honor, dignity and business reputation of the owner of Kazakhstan BTA-Bank Kenes Rakishev. <br><br>  The blocked publications dealt with the ‚Äúrelationship of a businessman with minors, bringing to suicide and concealing crimes‚Äù.  The proceedings regarding the publication of "false information" has been going on for two years.  Similar courts go not only in Russia, but also in Kazakhstan and Ukraine. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In October 2018, the court partially granted Kenes Rakishev‚Äôs claim to 40 Internet sites, including Facebook, Instagram, Kompromat.Ru, and LiveInternet ( <a href="https://www.mos-gorsud.ru/rs/tushinskij/services/cases/civil/details/2030ac92-9041-4323-b8f7-28ef1b9f70f2">case No. 02-1412 / 2018</a> ).  The businessman demanded to remove the information, recognize it as prohibited for distribution on the territory of Russia, and also recognize the activity of the sites as illegal.  The court agreed to block individual pages and acknowledged the violation of the rights to protect personal data, but refused to meet the remaining requirements. <br><br>  On November 8, 2018, a court decision was <a href="https://www.mos-gorsud.ru/rs/tushinskij/services/cases/civil/details/2030ac92-9041-4323-b8f7-28ef1b9f70f2">appealed</a> , but Facebook has already voluntarily fulfilled the requirements.  Now on the mentioned pages for Russian IP-addresses the inscription is displayed: "Content in the country of Russia is not available." <br><br>  Blocking content on social networks and other sites has become possible since April 2018, when the relevant <a href="http://publication.pravo.gov.ru/Document/View/0001201804230036">amendments to the legislation</a> were adopted.  The law establishes the possibility of blocking a site that has refused to comply with the legal requirement of the court and remove information that "denigrates the honor, dignity and business reputation of citizens or legal entities."  Previously, the refusal to delete information was threatened by a maximum of the site owner <br><br>  Until now, within the framework of the new law, very few law enforcement practices have commented on Sarkis Darbinyan, a lawyer with Roskomsvoboda.  But he is confident that the number of such cases will grow: For sure, people who have money for lawyers, for example, politicians and businessmen, will probably use the blockade.  "For ordinary people, the blockage is likely to remain inaccessible, because the trial is quite long and requires costs." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/431114/">https://habr.com/ru/post/431114/</a></p>
