  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is wrong with Russian-language IT publications</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/dcc/4e3/8fa/dcc4e38fa19e765c89e01bf5e7435453.jpg"><br><br>  What is important in a startup?  The idea, technology, team is, of course, good, but what distinguishes successful startups from others?  You can argue about this for a long time, but in the end, unfortunately, in most cases, success is determined by proper marketing.  Of course, one cannot underestimate the merits of the idea and the realization of the product, but I think you will agree if I say that marketing plays a much larger role. <br><br>  Each startup at an early stage of its development is trying to reach the maximum audience and all possible marketing channels.  But it is worth noting one promotion channel, which is huge compared to others, the potential result is huge, and the result can remind of itself for several years; moreover, this promotion channel can help not only attract users, but also employees, partners and even investors. ! <br><br>  This is, of course, about online publications that write about business, start-ups and IT.  Under the cut - a description of the problem, which all similar publications have, writing in Russian, as well as how we <a href="http://startupden.ru/">are trying</a> to solve it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So what is the problem with most media?  Most likely, you yourself know it, but it lies in the fact that all Russian-language publications are more likely to write news about an Apple product or a button (not) a dislay from Facebook than about a Russian startup that creates hand prostheses or a startup that is developing small spacecraft. <br><br>  As a result, publications themselves exacerbate so no small problem of the information vacuum.  Of course, they all have limited resources and cannot write about everything, so they have to decide whether to write material for the newsletter, which will reach the maximum audience and for which materials will be published in a dozen other publications or write unique material about a truly innovative startup from Russia, the founders of which will be able to tell not only about their project, but also about the mistakes and difficulties that they had to face in Russian realities.  Unfortunately, all the media chases primarily for traffic and in the end most often choose the first option. <br><br>  Many founders of successful startups say that they founded their company because they saw the problem and wanted to solve it, which is why they decided to take a step towards meeting the unknown and start working on solving this problem.  And we got a crazy idea, - ‚ÄúWhat if we try to solve this problem?‚Äù.  No sooner said than done. <br><br>  This is exactly how our new project appeared - <a href="http://startupden.ru/">startupden.ru</a> <br><br>  We are not going to write about another product from Apple, a new version of Android, or that Yahoo‚Äôs CEO has gone on vacation.  We want to concentrate solely on news related to the CIS, as well as on articles about business and start-ups.  For example, we recently reviewed the <a href="http://startupden.ru/p/russian-space">space</a> start-ups industry from Russia. <br><br>  So far, there are not as many materials as we would like, but we are working hard on this.  If you want us to write about your project, or you have interesting material for our publication - write, we will be happy to publish! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297236/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297236/</a></p>
