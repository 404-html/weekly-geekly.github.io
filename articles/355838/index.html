  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Roskomnadzor in the near future is going to block the largest porn sites</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The newspaper "Izvestia" <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/585309">reports</a> : <br><blockquote>  Roskomnadzor will add 136 porn sites at once to the black list.  To block access to them ordered Apastovsky District Court of Tatarstan to the supervisory authority.  So far in Russia there have been only isolated cases of the inclusion of such sites in the register of prohibited ones. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  - For the first time in our practice, one court decision requires restricting access to such a large number of pornographic sites.  The total volume of traffic to these sites is estimated at millions of visits, says Vadim Ampelonsky, the official representative of Roskomnadzor.  - The solution is formulated in such a way that, according to the law, the administrations of these resources have three days to completely reorient their sites.  All pornographic content must be removed from them, otherwise the sites will be blocked by operators. <br><br>  The prosecutor of the Apastovsky District appealed to the court in defense of an indefinite number of persons.  As recorded in the court decision, the prosecutor was engaged in verifying compliance with the law ‚ÄúOn Information, Information Technologies and Protection of Information.‚Äù  In accordance with it, ‚Äúthe dissemination of information that is aimed at propaganda for war, inciting national, racial or religious hatred and hostility, as well as other information, for the distribution of which provides criminal or administrative liability, is prohibited.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>The prosecutor entered the keywords ‚ÄúKazan prostitutes‚Äù and ‚Äúporn videos‚Äù into the Yandex search system ‚Äî a list of addresses and links was displayed.</b>  <b>According to the search results, a list of 136 Internet sites of porn sites was generated.</b>  <b>All of them were sent for examination to the history expert committee ‚ÄúTatarkino‚Äù at the Ministry of Culture.</b>  <b>The examination confirmed that on all these sites there is ‚Äúvideo information that is pornographic‚Äù.</b> <br>  The list of prosecutor's offices contains sites of very different levels of attendance.  In it there is, for example, a large American resource xHamster, which is included in the Top 100 of the international rating of porn sites of the statistical resource Alexa. </blockquote><br>  Tonight Roskomnadzor once again decided to probe public opinion and see the reaction of the population.  If there is a strong negative reaction, they will say that these are ‚Äúexcesses on the ground‚Äù.  The district court of Tatarstan is just ridiculous.  If the reaction is not, then, in principle, can add to the registry. <br><br>  In addition, the news is silent about this, but Lukomorye was nevertheless added to the registry 2 weeks ago, despite the fact that the article was banned for Russian ip addresses by the owner of the resource, like the previous ones. <br><br>  5-6 times, the owners of the resource changed the ip of the server, but with enviable regularity, the new ip also contribute to the registry. <br><br>  Which is typical when Facebook or Youtube bans the pages for Russian ip, Roskomnadzor is completely satisfied with this, like the previous actions of the owners of Lukomorye.  And then they decided to go on principle and put the squeeze on. <br><br>  Upd. <br>  Found court decisions with the listed links. <br><br>  There are those 136 links, including the Hamster: <a href="http://apastovsky.tat.sudrf.ru/modules.php%3Fname%3Dsud_delo%26srv_num%3D1%26name_op%3Ddoc%26number%3D250450717%26delo_id%3D1540005%26new%3D%26text_number%3D1">136</a> <br><br>  Judge Nigmatzyanova E.A.
