This encourages third-party application developers to work on optimizing their products for the ARM version of Windows 10. One of the companies that did this optimization was Google, the corporation began work on the ARM version of Google Chrome, having received relatively unexpected support. <br><br>  We are talking about Microsoft, it seems that it will work together with Google to implement this project.  Rather, it is <a href="https://9to5google.com/2018/11/19/microsoft-google-chrome-windows-10-arm/">already working</a> .  Redmond company is profitable because it wants to avoid the situation that has developed with Windows RT and applications for this OS - most of the software under normal versions of Windows were incompatible with RT. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In order to provide support for standard applications with Windows 10 for ARM, it was decided to emulate the x86 processor on such systems.  It is clear that this emulation selects resources and ordinary programs work rather slowly, especially in comparison with native ARM applications. <br><br>  Partly for this reason, users of ARM-optimized Windows 10 are forced to work with the Microsoft Edge browser, which works well with the native OS.  It is difficult to work with other browsers, including Chrome. <br><br>  But last month, a Qualcomm spokesman said that work is underway to create a Google Chrome port under Windows 10 for ARM.  This work has already begun, as stated by several sources.  Also, information that indirectly confirms the beginning of development can be found in commits found in the source code of Chromium's Gerrit. <br><br>  Some experts have argued that the development of Chrome under the ARM version of Windows 10 is a strategic move by Google.  But in fact, many commits were made by a couple of Microsoft developers, and not the former, but the current ones.  This may indicate that corporations cooperate, since they both benefit from such cooperation. <br><br>  From the Microsoft side, this is a smart move, since many applications depend on Google Chrome, including those based on Electron: Slack, Visual Studio Core and others, plus Node.js, which is based on the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/431026/">https://habr.com/ru/post/431026/</a></p>
