Yes, we need to test our work in * all * browsers and on all devices on which we can.  Yes, yes, of course. <br><br>  But now that Chromium, de facto, will be the only web engine, the existence of Firefox is critical. <br><br>  Even if you love Chrome, adore Gmail and literally live in Google Docs and Analytics, no company, let alone following the users of the advertising giant, should not control the Internet. <br><br>  Developing and implementing affordable standards occurs when the balance of corporate forces supports organizations like the W3C and cross-browser testing on various devices is part of any project. <br><br>  When only one rendering engine remains, well, many of us remember how the development of the web stopped for almost ten years, when developers tested only in IE6, and some for the same period, when Netscape was the only significant browser. <br><br>  Do not think that the need to test on phones can save us: most of them also use Chromium. <br><br>  And do not write off the desktop simply because many people love mobile phones more. <br><br>  When one company decides which ideas are worth supporting, which problems of accessibility are important and which are not, it suppresses innovation, spreads competition and opens the door to digital segregation, allows you to easily throw out certain groups of people from the web. <br><br>  So how to deal with it?  We are weak, we are poor?  Double the efforts we put into cross-browser testing.  Laying it in the requirements of each project, large and small.  Ensure that our colleagues, employers and customers understand what we are testing and why. <br><br>  Perhaps we can fight without fail showing colleagues and clients our work in Firefox instead of Chrome.  Just as a reminder that there are other browsers and some of them may set Chrome to heat.  (And as a bonus, you can use the excellent development tools built into Firefox.) <br><br>  Diversity is good for the web and for society.  And it starts with us. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/432440/">https://habr.com/ru/post/432440/</a></p>
