Why they quickly become useless</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc5/d92/7db/dc5d927db6da4ca68a59488e286cfa95.jpg" align="left"><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Offtop</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  A small digression.  I plan to write a series of articles with life hacks.  But this is not the life hacking that everyone is used to, such as how to kindle a fire with only a plastic bottle or how to build a quadrocopter from two old mixers.  In my articles, I will try to explain simple things that we encounter regularly and will try to explain how to do them more efficiently, quickly and less costly. </div></div><br><h2>  Introduction </h2><br>  When I was small, I often noticed that my parents have toothbrushes very quickly becoming the same as in the picture above.  From my such did not happen.  And this concerned not only toothbrushes, but all the brushes in the house: for cleaning the carpet (a usual household brush), for cleaning shoes, even for an old broom made from rods.  I did not attach any importance to this, because there are things that are much more interesting than thinking about brushes.  Then I just decided that these are bad brushes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But suddenly my wife‚Äôs toothbrush, which they bought 2 weeks ago, attracted my attention.  It began to look like a brush, although I bought myself the same brush 2 months ago and it is like new.  Now I thought.  Throwing back the cause of poor-quality brushes, I immediately understood the main reason. <br><br><h2>  Why it happens </h2><br>  Almost any brush is designed to clean the surface.  But how does she do it?  I am an artist so-so, but painted so that it was clear. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d5/7a9/885/6d57a9885f9d4a38a754e86e70553a28.png"></div><br>  That is, you drive bristles over the surface, they spread their tips into small gaps and sweep debris from the surface.  Some hard, sticky particles are scraped off due to the fact that many bristles in a short period of time stumble over them and gradually loosen. <br><br>  But the picture, how to use the brush: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ee/bc9/a0c/3eebc9a0c4f9468bab6793120f5880cd.png"></div><br>  See the difference? <br><br>  Here the saddest thing is even a toothbrush not spoiled in 2 weeks, but the fact that the quality of tooth brushing is fading away.  With the same success, you can rub them with not crumpled exercise book. <br><br><h2>  How to fix? </h2><br>  It's simple, you just need to press on the brush only slightly.  On any brush.  You can press hard on a rag, on a sponge, on some other means for cleaning surfaces, but not on brushes. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  I really hope that the article was useful for you.  If the format of the articles is clear to you, write in the comments what you would like to know next time.  I will try to understand the topic, identify the problem and find a solution. <br><br><h2>  UPDATE: </h2><br>  Do you even write in the comments, for which you are minus, so I can make corrections.  I'm trying to help and lose karma for it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/400475/">https://habr.com/ru/post/400475/</a></p>
