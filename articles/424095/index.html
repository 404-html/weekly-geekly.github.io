As it turned out, her passport indicated that by 2024 a wireless communication network should be created in the Russian Federation for socially significant objects and special consumers.  First of all, these are officials and representatives of the security services. <br><br>  The network will operate using LTE-450 technology, as <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2018/09/19/781258-sotovaya-set-dlya-chinovnikov">reported</a> by Vedomosti.  A feature of the technology is the ability to manage priorities for different groups of users.  In addition, subscriber devices in this range can work both in walkie-talkie mode and video stream transmission mode.  The network features of this standard are high speeds and low data transfer delays. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The network operator is likely to become Tele2, since the frequency range of 450 MHz, which is needed for network operation, is now used by T2 RTK Holding.  By the way, it was not possible to monetize the range, which is why the idea to provide it to special consumers appeared.  The latter will have the opportunity to work in their own network using special subscriber devices - smartphones with special applications that are designed to perform departmental tasks. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the conditions and budget required to create a special LTE network are not listed in the Digital Economy Passport.  But experts estimate that its total value may be about 73.4 billion rubles.  This amount follows from the calculations of one of the relevant departments. <br><br>  As for the frequency range, he got Tele2 along with Sky Link and some other Rostelecom mobile assets in 2014.  The operator is going to take part in the project, discussing this possibility with the relevant departments.  Tele2 has experience in providing services in the required range.  Thus, the operator, together with the DIT, provided emergency services at the World Cup - 2018 with communication. <br><br>  If Tele2 does not become the main performer of the new program, the state will have to withdraw a part of the range from it, in any case, the general director of TMT Consulting thinks Konstantin Ankilov.  According to some experts, it is impossible to create a modern network to work in such a narrow frequency band, otherwise LTE-450 would be in demand by the market.  Well, deploying a mobile network for special users, according to the same experts, is inefficient spending of budget funds. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/424095/">https://habr.com/ru/post/424095/</a></p>
