A lecturer sits in front of you with a full bottle of wine and tells cool and interesting stories on the topic: shows a video, sets music, reads poems and stories, shares personal experience, talks about films and dreams, gets drunk and sings.  When the bottle of red ends, the lecture ends.  Admission is free, but the lecturer can leave a tip in the hat, if it was a good evening, and the stories were not in vain.  What will be the lecture about falling in love?  About how addicted film characters and literary characters, about how love is written in poems and fairy tales, make a video on the phone and compose songs.  How to cope with it, if it is sad and non-reciprocal.  About how to survive and keep life down, if it is mutual.  About how falling in love becomes an obsession and a hormonal explosion.  In general, a bottle of wine is enough.  This no one else will tell you and will not show.  Tuesday, I am in love! </li></ul><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  <a href="https://m.alytics.ru/biznes-zavtrak">Business breakfast Alytics 25.12</a> </p><br><ul><li>  <strong>December 25 (Tuesday)</strong> </li><li>  Myasnitskaya 24 / 7s3 </li><li>  is free </li><li>  On December 25, a business breakfast on end-to-end analytics will be held in Moscow.
