It will come to your mind the day before departure to go over the engine in the garage, or finally put the bigfoot wheels and carry out a total tuning in order to race along the M-4 road in all its newfound beauty?  Hardly.  This is a matter of comfort, safety and sober thinking of the driver. <br><br>  But to take and automate the company so that it starts bringing super-profits tomorrow - this is please.  “What does it mean, impossible?  You are a vendor!  I pay you. ”It seems to you that you can implement CRM, ERP and other software right now in the company in which you work or which you head?  This is a misconception.  Any of your aspirations, beginnings and implementations from the first search query before starting work in a new IT infrastructure will face obstacles.  Some of them will fall down from where they did not expect - there are exactly as many surprises as there will be with bigfoot on M-4.  And even more.  For a more spectacular failure, follow our bad advice - we collected them for 11 years with sweat and blood.  In short, innovative hardcore, sometimes horror and bad quatrains from our team.  Do not shoot at programmers - we compose as we can. <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/company/regionsoft/blog/428339/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b0/46a/3e1/6b046a3e15e8ca2cb1bc25766c624522.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i><u><b>Disclaimer</b></u></i> <i><br></i>  <i>A little about the structure of the article.</i>  <i>At first we wanted to write only bad advice - with humor, irony and sarcasm.</i>  <i>But after the compilation of the primary list, our team somehow depressed.</i>  <i>It turned out that we essentially wrote the truth about the state of affairs in many organizations of small and medium-sized businesses - is it possible for us not to know when there are thousands of <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">RegionSoft CRM</a> implementations <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">behind us</a> ?</i>  <i>In general, everything would be funny if it were not so sad.</i>  <i>Therefore, after each “good advice” we added the “How Actually” block - about what to do.</i>  <i>It's not enough :-)</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c08/c1d/2dd/c08c1d2dd47007964f1a0287b20ed75e.png" width="500"></div><br>  <i>One link in the process can ruin the whole system.</i> <br><blockquote><h3>  Tie with business processes </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13f/2a6/981/13f2a6981706108198847bbbd9f12ffb.png" align="left">  Do not simplify business processes.  You have become accustomed to them, have been working with them for a hundred years and did not even suspect that all these approvals, actions and failure of deadlines are called “business process”.  If your CRM / ERP / BPM requires setting up processes, bring it in as it is, along with outdated steps, stretched deadlines and confusion in those responsible.  Give automation of the mess! <br><br>  Do not even try to assemble a working group, draw a process on paper or a flipchart, cross out the unnecessary and include the necessary one.  After all, then you will have much more free time at work and the authorities will certainly find what to occupy you.  Believe me, pulling the usual gum is much more fun than putting brains to something new and trying to make more money for the company (and, therefore, for yourself).  You are paid as much as you asked for, and probably even added a little bit. <br><br>  And in general, avoid the very concept of a business process.  If you implement it in a CRM system, then your work will become clear and transparent: the head of the office will not be able to forget to hand over the documents for signature to the general one, and the head of the sales department will have to create the shipment, collect the documents and transfer the task to the logistics as soon as possible.  The client will like this approach, he will bring three more, and this is a direct way to increase the amount of work.  And who wants to work! </blockquote><br><h4>  As a matter of fact </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/457/6cb/642/4576cb642ca56d1d19fc19bee453c19f.png" align="left">  The consequences of such advice are lost clients and money, uncoordinated processes and, as a consequence, working conflicts between employees. <br><br>  Today, service decides much more than price and even (oh, horror!) Product quality.  Even in the market of CRM-systems, promo and the speed of customer acquisition allow some not very advanced systems to strive for leadership.  This is a given, and it must be taken.  So, today the speed of decision making, reaction, choice is so great that there is nothing to do on the market without automation.  Often the client chooses you as a supplier, developer, retailer, consultant solely due to efficiency.  For example, a <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">CRM system</a> helps to be prompt and attentive to customers. <br><br>  Life example <br><br>  <i>Imagine that a company sells Chinese laptops with a cool upgrade.</i>  <i>And there are two such companies.</i>  <i>One makes mega cool: laser engraving of keys, setting up the OS, expanding the memory, an additional guarantee from the service company.</i>  <i>But all of it is two engineers who do it themselves, they call themselves, they do advertising in Direkt itself.</i>  <i>And another company actually only re-stitches the keys, but calls the customer and says: "If you order before November 1, you can re-replace the erased stickers for free."</i>  <i>At the same time, they know that their cheap stickers will be erased by June, and then in June they call and say: “Come, we have been waiting.”</i>  <i>A person comes, and there they are already offering him to expand the memory, and check for viruses, and another car and a small service cart.</i>  <i>Impressed with the service and free replacement of stickers, the client buys other services, advising the company to friends along the way.</i>  <i>Naturally, all the replacement periods, contacts and plans for additional sales are stored in the CRM-system, which allows you to stay ahead of the first company and “make money on the back.”</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>And this is the case everywhere - for example, if a year after receiving you receive a call from the dentist, are interested in how your tooth is called for a routine examination, you should know that the clinic has a CRM system (as well as money for development and high-quality equipment).</i> <br><br>  In addition, automated systems relieve the sales team, marketing, support and service, thereby increasing the time to work with one client and the degree of satisfaction.  No need to think about missed calls, meetings, affairs, forgotten documents, approvals, notifying colleagues - the same CRM system will take on this routine.  For example, in <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">RegionSoft CRM</a> such schemes are configured within the mechanism of business processes. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/84c/c7a/3a7/84cc7a3a76a42b343c584aebb6747412.png" width="500"></div><br>  <i>When saved on the proper integration.</i>  <i>And what, basically works the same!</i> <br><br><blockquote><h3>  No integration </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13f/2a6/981/13f2a6981706108198847bbbd9f12ffb.png" align="left">  If you have existing programs that you use from time to time or all the time, forget about integration.  Suppose you have a website, 1C, telephony server and suddenly you bought <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">RegionSoft CRM</a> .  Do not believe the vendor, do not buy the <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/loader.php%3Fsrc%3Dappsrv">RegionSoft Application Server</a> - why do you need to receive applications from the site directly to CRM, exchange data with 1C on a schedule or work with telephony, record calls and so on?  After all, there are employees on salary who can open a website or chat, pick up applications from the admin panel and put them into the CRM system with their hands.  Integration - this is all fantasy vendra, he is a software company, they are fixated on automation and building an orderly hierarchy of software in the company. <br><br>  If you do not have integrations, then in fact you do not lose anything.  Even a single information array of the company is useless: let each department have its own analyst.  If necessary, let them collect and exchange data. <br><br>  Keep a zoo of software, do not abandon old programs and in no case transfer data to the new system.  In the end, there may remain valuable old data that will need to be addressed in the future.  And payment ... Well, think about it, 900 rubles per user per month, there are only 15 of us.  Cheaper to pay for meals, you can afford! <br><br>  Well, and if you integrate - so integrate.  Tell your implementer that the CRM system should have all the data from 1C, and 1C all from CRM.  Then you will not even need to think about which system to log in to invoice or ship the goods.  Hooray!  This is the freedom of the mind! </blockquote><br><h4>  As a matter of fact </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/457/6cb/642/4576cb642ca56d1d19fc19bee453c19f.png" align="left">  No one says that it is necessary to integrate all automation systems, but certain bundles are mandatory.  For example, a CRM system should be somehow integrated with the site, with telephony, exchange some (!) Data with 1C (for example, from CRM in 1C only counterparties are transmitted, for which there is a realization, data on the implemented nomenclature and related objects, and from 1C in CRM incoming payments).  This allows you to create end-to-end automation, the effectiveness of which is much higher than the sum of the efficiencies of disparate software. <br><br>  And, especially, to integrate all the information between 1C and CRM - this is akin to delirium.  Firstly, this is stupid, since any duplication of information must be exclusively justified, and it is virtually impossible to justify the content of two different systems with the same data.  Secondly, it is technologically very difficult, and because of this expensive.  Just imagine the complexity of the integration process, for example, warehouse accounting in two different systems, so that all documents, register movements, balances, costs, lots, etc. are identical.  This story is from a science fiction movie. <br><br>  And of course, you need to get rid of the old software - this is expensive, you can count. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/139/8be/885/1398be885904680467e85a7e58317427.png" width="500"></div><br><blockquote><h3>  Use the most powerful tools. </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13f/2a6/981/13f2a6981706108198847bbbd9f12ffb.png" align="left">  Even if you are a very small company, you can find € 150 per user per month to buy an almost top-end version of Salesforce.  Of course, you will not use more than 10% of the functions, but your company will have a cool imported tool with an English-language interface (wow, western technology is cool!).  They can brag to friends and partners - what not to say, automation of the European level! <br><br>  When you choose a CRM system for yourself, by all means form a request for advanced capabilities: the presence of artificial intelligence, machine learning, VR technology.  Let neural networks learn from your data - for 4000 records is real big data!  Pay special attention to the availability of OLAP-analytics and database vendor - your client base will feel confident at least in Oracle.  And it doesn’t matter that the vendor ensures that your data volume works perfectly with open source DBMSs - there is no good free. </blockquote><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f52/e51/c0f/f52e51c0f8d44ff8b40f0de9cbf49eac.png" width="500"></div><br><blockquote><h3>  Use the simplest tools. </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13f/2a6/981/13f2a6981706108198847bbbd9f12ffb.png" align="left">  For those who on the contrary love to save.  Why buy a powerful CRM system when keeping a list of customers and deals is sufficient in a simple CRM system, preferably free?  Yes, there are limitations and there are no backups, but this should not alarm you.  Restrictions will not affect you if you delete already closed transactions from the database, and backups are even simpler to do - for example, you can import the database into Excel or a text file once every three days and, not to lose, send it to yourself by mail.  In case of problems with the base, you just go into the box and pull out the actual data.  True, in free systems, data import is usually forbidden - but it doesn’t matter, you can drive it with your hands. <br><br>  It’s not a pity to stop using a simple CRM system; again, you can quickly get used to the new one.  And the main advantage is that you will be spared from unnecessary and unnecessary functions.  Some business processes, call records, etc.  What the hell do you need is an email client built into CRM, if you can coolly use free mail.ru or Yandex mail?  There will be enough signs with the necessary data, customer cards, transactions and sales funnel.  But seriously speaking, the best CRM system is Excel. </blockquote><br><h4>  <font color="#cc0000">As a matter of fact</font> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/457/6cb/642/4576cb642ca56d1d19fc19bee453c19f.png" align="left">  Of course, any automation system should not meet the criteria of high cost, coolness or prestige of the brand, but the specific requirements of the company.  As they say, the suit on the figure should be cut.  Therefore, before implementation, it is worth examining the needs, compiling a list of vendors and choosing based on the needs of the system, as well as the convenience of work.  In this case, it happens that 3-4 solutions are suitable.  Then you need to choose the functions that are most critical for you and see how they are implemented by whom.  For example, <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">RegionSoft CRM</a> is not at all "friendly" with social networks, but it is pumped through in terms of automation of work with the b2b sector in the form of the availability of warehouse accounting modules, multi-production, project management, work with telephony and primary, planning, business processes, depth client card content. <br><br>  Oddly enough, the price is too low or too high - this is the last thing you should focus on when implementing.  First, often the price is put from the ceiling (“let's get 19 990 for a license”), secondly, the high cost may be due to unnecessary and unclaimed twists (for example, the formal presence of AI in the system), thirdly, the price is too low or conditional free of charge most often turn out to be a marketing trap.  In general, “Ponte is more expensive than money” and “Fraer’s greed was killed” are not the best sayings for automating small and medium businesses. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a18/ca6/237/a18ca623724527c7bd567de1f366f000.png" width="500"></div><br><blockquote><h3>  Do not spend on safety </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13f/2a6/981/13f2a6981706108198847bbbd9f12ffb.png" align="left">  Here and there, there are Fecebook leaks, Salesforce leaks, leaks in large corporations.  It is understandable - such data arrays are attractive both for fraudsters and for the purposes of further sale.  And why would anyone need data from a small business in Russia?  What can be squeezed out of a commercial information store, advertising agency or a construction company?  Why, then, overpay for security: for backups, separation of access rights, protection of information?  After all, if you do not do this, you can achieve tangible savings. <br><br>  Never make backups of the database, because no one notices this anyway.  It is better to free up the space to upload pictures or erotic videos.  And if the database collapses (which is very unlikely), you can simply quit the office quickly, and shift the data recovery problems to a new employee. <br><br>  Choose CRM in the cloud, and public, - so cheaper.  You just get your piece of shared storage, and no one and nothing can stop you from using it.  Yes, the provider may have problems, but it rather quickly restores the servers.  In addition, systems in the cloud in 99% of cases are rented, and the price is quite small - for example, 990 p.  per user per month.  And if you have 20 people in the company, it’s only 19,800 p.  per month - less than the salary of almost any employee. </blockquote><br><h4>  <font color="#cc0000">As a matter of fact</font> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/457/6cb/642/4576cb642ca56d1d19fc19bee453c19f.png" align="left">  We could now talk about the fact that developers, retailers, clinics, etc. should take care of security especially.  But no - everyone needs to take care of the security of the client database and data.  There is nothing more serious than the information security of the company and in particular the customer base.  Even if you are a tiny outdoor advertising agency or a Yandex Direct partner, your data will be just the way to your competitors.  Which, contrary to your expectations, are not asleep, but are actively hunting for your managers with a base.  And then there are offended employees, fraudsters, unscrupulous providers without complying with SLA - and all this is a cumulative risk for you, your business, your money. <br><br>  We tell you everything by the example of a CRM system as the most universal software, which should be in general in any company, but in fact there are security threats in any software: you can also damage or steal drawings, code, analytics, photos, schemes, business process logic, financial documents, supplier lists, and more.  Even in the military departments, where everything seems to be arranged seriously from a security point of view, incidents such as transferring secret data to third parties occur. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2d0/f79/dd8/2d0f79dd8197def6313fbeac270057b4.png" width="500"></div><br>  <i>Cultivator without TZ, how it works - HZ</i> <br><blockquote><h3>  Never write TK and do not collect requirements </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13f/2a6/981/13f2a6981706108198847bbbd9f12ffb.png" align="left">  Do you know that a vendor makes up a technical task for an additional fee?  In no case do not let him earn!  A good vendor, as a rule, has implemented software for not one hundred companies, and therefore must be experienced and offhand to know what kind of automation any business needs.  A professional vendor is practically a visionary, he is familiar with any type of business and is able to solve the problems of any company on the fly.  Of course, your supplier CRM, ERP, PLM, etc.  may be very lucky if you have a TK for software left by a previous developer 5 years ago.  Give this technical task to the vendor, he will be happy. <br><br>  If for some reason the vendor created the TZ and gave it to you for signing - do not read anything and do not delve into the essence of the document, this is not a contract, but just a piece of paper to calm the nerves of the vendor’s engineers.  Refusing to draw up a TZ, you will not just save money - you will save yourself from control over each stage of implementation - you pay a real pro, why control something else.  They are obliged to provide you with software that will clearly meet your global requirement, “I meant that it should have been that way.” <br><br>  And of course, in no case do not collect requirements from your colleagues.  Just imagine: you need to form a working group, review processes, interview employees, analyze information, highlight requirements ... And this is during working hours!  Well, judge for yourself - what is special about sales or production? </blockquote><br><h4>  <font color="#cc0000">As a matter of fact</font> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/457/6cb/642/4576cb642ca56d1d19fc19bee453c19f.png" align="left">  In the life of the technical task is the basis for successful implementation.  This is a document that the developer creates, and usually does it for a fee, because to prepare the TOR, it is necessary to analyze the client’s requirements, dive into its tasks, select a development model, design and describe the workings of the created mechanisms and functions as thoroughly as possible, state it all in printed form and agreed with the customer.  The technical task is signed along with the contract, but unlike the standard contract it is an individual document defining the essence of the project.  TK guarantees the accuracy of work and deadlines.  This is an absolutely obligatory document, unless you order the development of a student, and the entire project does not cost 5,000 rubles. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/613/3c3/664/6133c366431f0fc9731e4e166b388e44.png" width="500"></div><br><blockquote><h3>  Refuse to make improvements </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13f/2a6/981/13f2a6981706108198847bbbd9f12ffb.png" align="left">  Why do we need any improvements?  In normal software, all the necessary things are by default.  In the end, you can bring a free model of work under the one that is implemented in the selected CRM system.  Otherwise, then you will constantly pay money for some work that will never end. </blockquote><br><h4>  <font color="#cc0000">As a matter of fact</font> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/457/6cb/642/4576cb642ca56d1d19fc19bee453c19f.png" align="left">  It's simple: if the implementation is necessary, it needs to be implemented.  But to do this wisely, to balance the functionality and cost of implementation, which you can afford and lead to the desired result. <br><br>  First you need to identify the main tasks, without which you can not work.  In the process of testing the solution (usually it is a demo version or a test key that can be ordered from the vendor), you should open for each of these tasks, whether their system performs and at what level (excellent / good / satisfactory).  If some of the main tasks are implemented insufficiently - negotiate with the vendor and clarify whether they can be adapted to your requirements.  You will have the first and most important list of improvements. <br><br>  If the vendor is ready for the necessary improvements, fix them for yourself and continue further - make a list of missing opportunities that you can put up with, for example, for the first time.  Determine for yourself the period for which you need to realize these opportunities.  Negotiate with the vendor, evaluate the technical capability, approximate time and cost.  Make a technical task. <br><br>  In fact, after that you will have almost a complete idea of ​​whether this solution will suit you or not.  In addition, you will have a complete list of the necessary improvements, an assessment of their cost and timing of implementation.  You will be fully armed and will be able to make an informed decision, including, if necessary, split the implementation into several stages.  The result is not long in coming. <br><br>  Tip: When drafting requirements, do not force the vendor to break the structure of the application so that it requires global reworking of the entire system.  It is always very expensive and time consuming, and also does not provide a high stability of the resulting solution.  The correct way is to partially adapt to the basic capabilities of the system, and in places where it is impossible to adapt, it is impossible to modify it for yourself.  If such bilateral adaptation is impossible - it is better to look for another system. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/028/8c7/165/0288c7165ba9ce339fe25ea5ab0c35ce.png" width="500"></div><blockquote><h3>  Keep development in check, growth requires resources </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13f/2a6/981/13f2a6981706108198847bbbd9f12ffb.png" align="left">  Do not let the company grow.

Again, there is a risk of being uninteresting for employees and losing the most professional and ambitious ones.  Scaling is almost always a blessing, especially when it is organic, it should not be missed. <br><br>  Fast growth without loss of efficiency is possible only if the business is ready.  And you need to prepare the sleigh in the summer, well, that is, all the conditions must be created in advance - it does not happen that on Wednesday you were a small company, and on Thursday you woke up average.  So, several aspects should be implemented: <br><br><ul><li>  business processes have been established and automated - so you can easily scale and withstand the increase and complexity of tasks; <br></li><li>  all key processes and management should be automated (at a minimum, this is CRM or ERP, the rest of the software set depends on the field of activity); <br></li><li>  Your employees must be efficient - that is, ready for workload, changes, new tasks. <br></li></ul><br>  Automation will solve most of the problems associated with time-consuming processes, routine tasks and issues, "rake" part of the workflow.  In addition, at a certain point in the scale of the business, the manager comes to the realization that numbers are starting to rule his head.  Statistics.  Different.  To do this, criteria should be built, with the help of which you will assess the condition of your business, its growth points or stagnation.  And for their evaluation it is necessary to have a basic element - the measurements themselves, without which it is impossible to perform an assessment. <br><br>  Those.  with the growth of business, the approach to its understanding and management is changing, business processes are changing.  Consequently, the CRM system must be “alive”, responding to the changing conditions of the business environment.  A competent leader should take this into account if he wants to go higher. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eaf/393/b95/eaf393b95d9798d05035c70e8c955e1e.png" width="500"></div><br><blockquote><h3>  Make your software, it is 100% cooler </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13f/2a6/981/13f2a6981706108198847bbbd9f12ffb.png" align="left">  This story begins always the same.  The CEO and the chief accountant review the list of proposed automation systems (for example, CRM), consider that all this is expensive and declare to the whole office: “What are we going to buy?  We'll drink our CRM on the knee! ”At this pathetic moment, the technical director feels a bottle of brandy in the table, HR quietly ooh ... oops (groans) from the prospect of looking for a group of programmers“ fullstack and cheaper ”, thoughtful employees calculate how many reworkings they will have working group.  Of course, this all rallies the team and leads them to a single goal - their own CRM system. <br><br>  You will spend only 5-7 years, but you will get quite a working release 1.0 in which you can already lead clients, build a sales funnel, generate simple reports and issue a beautiful panel with data for the general.  Developing your CRM, you will fully experience all the delights of development, learn something about design, interfaces, backend and security.  This is a definite plus, especially for technology companies - indeed, if you are a small Internet provider or seller of agricultural equipment, why not confirm your manufacturability? </blockquote><br><h4>  <font color="#cc0000">As a matter of fact</font> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/457/6cb/642/4576cb642ca56d1d19fc19bee453c19f.png" align="left">  Developing your own software, especially enterprise level, is an expensive and resource-intensive project.  You invest a lot of effort, money, time, nerves, and at the exit in a few years you will receive an automation system of the most basic level (this applies not only to CRM, they are experimenting with other types of corporate software). <br><br>  You need to understand that the CRM system is not just a task scheduler.  This is a complex network infrastructure solution for teamwork of a team of people.  Those typical solutions that are on the market have been created over the years and have been developing for decades; tens and hundreds of millions (and not always rubles) are spent on their development.  And if a typical product with a bunch of functionality can be bought on 1 day for 100 thousand rubles, and for a couple of months, another 100 thousand rubles.  to refine what is missing in it, then you need to create a similar system from scratch for at least 5 years and spend 10 million rubles in aggregate.  or more.  And it’s not a fact that by that moment your company <s>will</s> not <s>grow / roll out will</s> change its business and it will need another solution. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13b/869/05e/13b86905ea9dae63d5da55cf5059c03b.png" width="500"></div><br><blockquote><h3>  Sit on money and do not move </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13f/2a6/981/13f2a6981706108198847bbbd9f12ffb.png" align="left">  If your business is not going the way you would like, immediately reduce costs: lay off people, give up bonuses, voluntary medical insurance and meals, by all means freeze all automation projects.  After staff reductions, distribute tasks to the remaining employees so that they will be too difficult.  This will lead to additional savings, but the survivors - your stone wall, which is most loyal to you.  Collect all the money available to the company, and do not try to spend a single ruble on development.  This is a great way to ride out crisis, sanctions and economic stagnation. <br><br>  Save on everything: on equipment, equipment, the Internet, and especially - on servers.  Triple save if you are not a software company, but you work in any other area. <br><br>  Ahead of the New Year and a whole series of holidays.  You can cool save if December 25 to dismiss all employees, and on January 15 to recruit new ones.  Firstly, for almost a whole month one does not have to pay wages and taxes from it (it’s still holidays, to feed these freeloaders), and secondly, when you take new ones in January, issue a probationary period with a reduced salary.  That's cool!  Imagine what a savings !!! <br><br>  Especially fear the introduction of automation systems of anything, for example, CRM-systems.  It is not known when such an investment will pay off.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And then you have to keep the staff, because someone in this CRM will have to work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And in general, the larger the company, the harder it is to maintain it.</font></font></blockquote><br><h4> <font color="#cc0000"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As a matter of fact</font></font></font> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/457/6cb/642/4576cb642ca56d1d19fc19bee453c19f.png" align="left"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The lack of automation in a crisis can play a cruel joke: in fact, a company loses an additional powerful resource that can work tirelessly and provide operations. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Overloaded with tasks and stress of the crisis period, employees may more often be mistaken, not cope with the volume of work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, a CRM system can automate part of routine processes, “take over” reminders, mailings, segmentation, deadlines, etc. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thus, employees have time and energy to maneuver.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, if your customer base is segmented and classified, you can, during the economic stagnation, conduct economical, but highly effective actions aimed at specific customer segments, thereby not letting your potential customers forget about you and prepare them for active work as soon as economic stagnation will end its temporary period. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And you will surely be ahead of those of your competitors who have not taken care of this ...</font></font><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b91/e49/87b/b91e4987b828c3951cd21a720cef335c.png" width="500"></div><br><blockquote><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Work only with your hands and head. </font></font></h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13f/2a6/981/13f2a6981706108198847bbbd9f12ffb.png" align="left"> Ручной труд — самый ценный и во многом самый дорогой в мире.

Если вы всё же не можете жить без модных вещей вроде CRM-систем, выбирайте бесплатное программное обеспечение — все эти ограничения на записи, пользователей, документы и особенно отсутствие бэкапов — мелочи жизни, не несущие никакой пользы.
