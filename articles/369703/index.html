The microblogging service has long been experiencing financial difficulties due to difficulties with monetization: Twitter does not have paid functions for users, and advertising does not bring satisfactory results. <br><br>  According to the same source close to the company's management, the Twitter board of directors is actively discussing the option of selling the company, but no final agreement has been reached with a specific buyer.  Rumors independently confirm <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/23/twitter-may-receive-formal-bid-shortly-suitors-said-to-include-salesforce-and-google.html">CNBC</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/23/salesforce-google-twitter/">TechCrunch</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/96f/794/244/96f79424476d4e0adda1b1de1c1d0c62.png"><br>  <em>The dynamics of the value of Twitter shares over the past 5 days</em> <br><br>  Amid these rumors, the company's market capitalization jumped by 22% and now stands at $ 13.3 billion. <br><br>  Four companies are showing interest in Twitter: Google, Microsoft, Verizon and <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/">Salesforce</a> .  It is Salesforce that are called the most likely buyer of the problem service.  But their capital is only half of the current value of Twitter, plus the company has already spent more than 4 billion on other acquisitions since the beginning of the year. <br><br>  Previously, they have already missed the deal to buy LinkedIn, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/277216/">giving way to Microsoft</a> .  Twitter, however, can provide a wealth of data that will support the core business of Salesforce and generally fits into the company's business model. <br><br>  However, do not forget about the main “buyer” of IT-companies.  It's about google.  According to experts, Google’s “free” budget, that is, the money they can spend to buy something, was $ 73.1 billion at the beginning of this year.  And if the search giant aspires to buy Twitter, he will get it.  In addition, the company has long been trying to enter the social networking market, but has not achieved any serious success in this.  The only powerful social asset of Google today is YouTube. <br><br>  Verizon was also not against Twitter, but the company recently bought AOL, and now it is making a deal to buy Yahoo. <br><br>  According to TechCrunch, rumors about the possible participation of another giant, Microsoft, are more likely to be dispelled in order to inflate the price of Twitter, and not because Microsoft is interested in buying it. <br><br>  The audience of the microblogging service is 313 million people per month.  As a social network in the number of Twitter users surpass only Facebook and YouTube. <br><br>  The service has its own formed community and a unique model, which together makes it an interesting acquisition. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369703/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369703/</a></p>
