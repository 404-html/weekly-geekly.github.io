The new series is called ‚ÄúSponsored Content‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Last week on Wednesday, the world saw a new episode of the satirical American TV series South Park, dedicated to online advertising, the battle of users who want to get rid of it, and online publications.  The creators of the cartoon through familiar characters share their opinions about how much advertising has infected the Internet, becoming smarter and disguised as news material.  According to Contently's research, most users encounter difficulties in trying to distinguish regular news content from sponsored content. <br><br>  The episode begins with the fact that the disabled boy, Jimmy, who writes for the school newspaper, refuses to give it up for editing to the school principal and delivers it himself to the homes of residents, whom the newspaper begins to impress in the first place because of the lack of advertising in it.  Thus, Jimmy and his newspaper are rapidly gaining popularity.  Noticing this, advertisers lined up for him in order to place their customized content on the pages of the Jimmy newspaper.  The creators of the series decided to leave the open final, without telling whether the boy would agree to attractive offers from advertisers. <br><br>  The characters in this episode also say that they often cannot distinguish advertising from regular content, and that, based on information about their habits and passions, they are given such advertising that could interest them.  As a result, reading the news can be compared to the road through the impassable jungle of the most varied information and banal garbage, and the user experience very soon boils down to a dull viewing of banner ads. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296626/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296626/</a></p>
