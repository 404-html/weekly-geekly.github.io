  <section class="page js-page"><h1>U> X> I> P ... or “How the names of professions play leap-frog”</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Almost artistic note based on documentary observations :) <br><br>  A lot of interesting things can be noticed if you look at thematic posts and vacancies in the field of digital products interfaces (UI, UX, etc.).  Life is in full swing, many conferences, new technologies and tools, speeches, trends for the next year ... but something does not fit ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For example: <br><br><ul><li>  "Beauty" in the interfaces involved UI-designers; </li><li>  User Interface designing is done by ... UX-designers; </li><li>  User experience and impressions obtained by users (User eXperience) are in charge of ... service designers; </li><li>  Designing a service or service migrated to product managers, and product designers are doing everything at once, if they have time (the original meaning of the term Product designer is “industrial product designer”). </li></ul><br>  An amazing exception to this wordplay is user / audience researchers (UX Research).  They do exactly what is written on their business cards — explore user experience and impressions (UX). <br><br>  By the way, all of the above specialists are diligently hostile to marketers - specialists in the audience and sales markets of the products they create.  Hmm ... is it true that a specialist in market demand can be aware of user needs? <br><br>  The severity of the situation adds the word "design".  In English, it has a ton of colors to reflect the decision-making process — from design to design or malicious intent (Is it by design? :)).  "Design, pattern, designer" - its secondary value.  In the Russian language, the word “design” is consistently associated with the artistic design and visual component of the object being created. <br><br>  Add to the listed words like “usability” or “experience”, which have specific dictionary meanings in English, but do not have direct analogues in Russian.  We will take into account a certain closure of professional communities and the formation of slang.  What we get in the end? <br><br>  For the Russian-speaking audience, words like “UX”, “UI-designer”, “UI / UX” become a kind of hieroglyphics.  A person “not from a party” (read - team lead, HR or business owner) understands them with difficulty and only approximately.  People for whom native English is experiencing severe cognitive dissonance when they encounter such a hodgepodge.  So hard that Don Norman, the author of the term “UX”, comes up with an interview in defense of his original meaning. <br><br>  And so, the next team of designers, armed with a similar jumble of terms, goes to the management of “selling design” or “promoting UX”.  He gives them an idea and gets a logical answer: “@% # @ $ # &amp; * ?!  o_O. <br><br>  So do not sell the elephant.  This is confirmed by numerous posts on the topic "What if the business does not accept the design?". <br><br>  General misunderstanding around user interfaces and associated terminology is not useful to everyone.  Experts, even if they want, can not communicate normally with the business.  Business misses the benefits that could be obtained if it were not confused with vague terms.  Users daily suffer from strange products (to make sure enough to go to every second ATM). <br><br>  Conclusion?  Clear definitions of terms will be extremely good for all participants in the process. <br><br>  <i>PS Some may say: “But we have a small startup.</i>  <i>We cannot hire a lot of specialists, but we need to name that one only one.</i>  <i>Let's call him “UX”. ”.</i>  <i>There is a logic in these words, but if instead of an abbreviation, which is divorced from meaning and vocabulary, to write “universal interface specialist” it will all be a bit easier for everyone.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>In a larger company, clear words of benefit will be even greater.</i>  <i>For example:</i> <i><br><br></i> <ul><li>  HR will stop inviting illustrators to tasks involving the collection of business requirements; </li><li>  Tim-lead programmers will be able to exhale and stop thinking through the logic of the interface, this will make the interaction designer; </li><li>  And the illustrator will be inspired to draw in his favorite style instead of a boring recounting of possible screen states. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/429964/">https://habr.com/ru/post/429964/</a></p>
