  <section class="page js-page"><h1>VKontakte launched money transfer service</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, Vkontakte seems to have rolled out a new update.  Some users already could see notifications in chat rooms (in the web version for sure) about the new service. From today, social network users have the opportunity to make transfers from plastic cards to other users.  I do not know if everyone has access, perhaps, as often happens with them, the update will roll out in waves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/131/934/f78/131934f78ffb6d25334dcf492063ba24.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  How it works? <br>  Open a dialogue with the person to whom you send the transfer, select the ‚ÄúMoney‚Äù item in the attachment menu, enter the amount and comment, use a bank card, confirm the sending.  The recipient will receive a message with the transfer, and he will choose which card to transfer funds to.  Sending from Russia, receiving in 17 countries. <br></blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/336/57e/242/33657e242e7e736f6b5b8aa94a54cf87.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Conditions </h3><br>  Send money in messages using a bank card.  The recipient's card number is not needed - he will decide where to transfer funds. <br><br><h4>  Geography </h4><br>  You can send money <b>from</b> Mastercard, Maestro and Visa cards <b>issued in Russia</b> . <br>  You <b>can</b> transfer <b>money to</b> Mastercard, Maestro and Visa cards <b>issued in Russia</b> , as well as Mastercard and Maestro cards issued in the following countries: Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Germany, Georgia, Israel, Italy, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Romania , Uzbekistan, France, Czech Republic, Estonia. <br><br><h4>  Commission </h4><br>  For transfers from Mastercard and Maestro cards - not charged as part of the promotion *. <br>  For transfers from Visa cards - 1% of the amount, at least 40 rubles. <br><br><h4>  Limits </h4><br>  The transfer amount is from 100 to 75,000 rubles. <br>  The maximum amount of sent, received transfers on one card is 150,000 rubles per day, 600,000 rubles per month. <br>  Commission in limits is not taken into account. <br><br><h4>  Timing </h4><br>  The term of transfer to the card of the recipient depends on the bank that issued the card, and ranges from several minutes to several days. <br><br>  The recipient can accept the transfer within 5 days from the moment of sending.  If this does not happen, or the recipient declined the transfer, the money is returned to the sender card. <br><br>  The sender may cancel the transfer until it is accepted by the recipient. <br><br><h4>  Other conditions </h4><br>  * Promotion with Mastercard.  When sending transfers from Mastercard and Maestro cards, no commission is charged.  Once a week, when you receive a transfer to a Mastercard or Maestro card, you can choose as a gift one of the suggested sets of VKontakte stickers.  The number of gifts is limited.  The promotion will last until January 8, 2017.  Organizer: V Kontakte LLC. <br><br>  Transfers are made in Russian rubles.  If the sender or beneficiary card is linked to an account in another currency, the corresponding amount in rubles is converted into the account currency at the rate of the bank that issued the card. <br><br>  The operation of debiting from the sender's card is carried out using 3-D Secure technology, ensuring maximum security of transfers. <br><br>  The bank that issued the card may set its own commissions and restrictions on sending and receiving transfers from card to card.  Be especially careful when sending a transfer from a credit card: your bank may regard this as a cash withdrawal and withhold a commission, and the grace period for such transactions usually does not apply. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397767/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397767/</a></p>
