  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Astronomers have discovered an exoplanet in a system of 4 stars.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c4f/dd7/2e6/c4fdd72e699a66f63982ad69e19f79a1.jpg"><br>  <i>So, according to the artist, the union of stars and planets of the 30 Ari star system can look if viewed from a certain point in space</i> <br><br>  Exoplanets were discovered relatively recently, but over the course of several years of searching, scientists were able to find many hundreds of exoplanets of various sizes.  Naturally, it is easiest to detect large objects that are relatively easy to identify.  Earth-like planets are less common (perhaps because they are harder to find) than the large gas giants. <br><br>  By the way, among the found planetary systems there are very unusual.  But the recent discovery of scientists is probably the most unusual of all.  So, astronomers have discovered an exoplanet that is in a 4-star system!  The planet itself is very big - it is 10 times larger than our Jupiter.  Previously it was thought that this star system was a triple, but recently another star was discovered - a red dwarf hiding for the time being from the gaze of earth scientists. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In principle, all this sounds very unusual - a planet in a system of four stars.  But scientists believe that it is not such a rarity - about 4% of the total number of such systems can be.  The 4-star system in question is located 146 light-years from us, on the outskirts of our Galaxy. <br><br>  Exoplanet in this system makes a revolution around its star for 335 days.  The main star has a "counterweight", the second star, which revolves around a common center.  In addition, the "partner" has a star - a satellite, but now it turns out that the main star also has a satellite. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/828/697/984/828697984545c87e88236ddcb43e2632.jpg"><br><br>  When asked about the possibility of life on such a planet (or on a satellite of such a planet, if he / they are), scientists answer that the conditions of the system are so complex that life can hardly exist here.  In any case, in the form in which we know life. <br><br>  It is worth noting that this is the second exoplanet, which is found in the system of four stars.  The first, KIC 4862625, was discovered through the work of the Kepler telescope.  The fact that two such systems were discovered in a relatively short time may indicate that such systems are not so rare. <br><br>  According to scientists who have discovered such a system, there may well be much more complex alliances of stars and planets in the universe.  Now experts are studying possible models of the origin of multi-star systems. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/377121/">https://habr.com/ru/post/377121/</a></p>
