One of the "sides" in the separation did not move to the desired distance and hit the fuel tank of the second stage, which led to the rupture of the tank and the destruction of the second stage.  The reason for this, that the commission found, was the abnormal operation of the sensor, which signals the divergence of the first and second stages. ‚Äù </blockquote><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The statement was made at a solemn event dedicated to the 55th anniversary of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP). <br><br>  The Soyuz FG accident was the first emergency in the last 35 years when a manned ship was launched, TASS <a href="https://tass.ru/kosmos/5740702">reports</a> .  Habrayuzer <a href="https://habr.com/users/lozga/" class="user_link">lozga</a> says that the last time a similar situation was in 1975 on the Soyuz-18-1.  Then, due to the accident of the carrier, the ship was forced to perform a suborbital flight, and now the ship with the crew has successfully landed in Kazakhstan. <br><br>  Clarification of the causes of the accident was a prerequisite in order to continue the launches of the "Unions" and for the insurance companies to agree to insure these launches, albeit now at elevated rates. <br><br>  A source in the rocket and space industry told TASS that the first launch of the Soyuz-FG rocket after the accident is scheduled for November 16.  The launch of the Progress MS-10 cargo vehicle to the ISS is scheduled for 21:14 Moscow time from Baikonur. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428331/">https://habr.com/ru/post/428331/</a></p>
