  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sistema creates a venture fund headed by Alexey Katkov, former vice-president of the Mail.Ru Group</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  According <a href="http://www.interfax.ru/business/472769">to</a> Interfax, AFK Sistema creates a venture capital fund, which will deal mainly with investments in the Internet industry.  The main field of interest of the fund will be investments in consumer research and audience building technologies, financial and near-financial services, new media and modern advertising technologies.  The fund will be established on the basis of a subsidiary of System Mass Media (SMM).  Its head will be Alexei Katkov, who has devoted more than fifteen years of his life to the Russian Internet company Mail.ru Group, having worked there since it was founded.  Since 2007, he served as vice president and commercial director of the company, and three years ago he was also charged with the duties of director of international development.  It is known that in April, he left Mail.ru Group. <br><br>  AFK President Mikhail Shamolin, in turn, noted: ‚ÄúWith the appointment of Alexei, we are starting to implement plans for entering new promising markets in the digital environment.  A number of factors allow us to look with optimism at the future of this project - this is the continuing growth of the Russian Internet market, which has great potential, and the unique competitive advantages of Sistema, and the great demand for high-tech assets. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Shamolin mentioned the possibility of Sistema creating a venture fund back in 2011.  Then he pointed out that 100-150 million dollars of investment capital could be allocated to startups. <br><br>  The opening of the fund is scheduled for 2016.  Currently, the size of the fund is not disclosed.  As for his strategy, the board expects it to be formed by Katkov himself and his team.  If we talk about the future of the current assets of the SMM itself after the creation of a venture capital fund, the representative of AFK announced the following information: ‚ÄúThe assets that today are included in the perimeter of the SMM are successful independent businesses.  Today, various scenarios are being considered. ‚Äù <br><br>  Note that the SMM holding owns and manages such companies as CJSC STREAM Broadcasting Company, Maxima advertising agency, United Russian Film Studios and the DTV LLC (car television). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295278/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295278/</a></p>
